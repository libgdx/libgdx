/** <p>
 * An <code>Application</code> is the main entry point of your project. It sets up a window and rendering surface and manages the
 * different aspects of your application, namely {@link Graphics}, {@link Audio}, {@link Input} and {@link Files}. Think of an
 * Application being equivalent to Swing's <code>JFrame</code> or Android's <code>Activity</code>.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * An application can be an instance of any of the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a desktop application (see <code>JglfwApplication</code> found in gdx-backends-jglfw.jar)</li>
 * <li>an Android application (see <code>AndroidApplication</code> found in gdx-backends-android.jar)</li>
 * <li>a HTML5 application (see <code>GwtApplication</code> found in gdx-backends-gwt.jar)</li>
 * <li>an iOS application (see <code>IOSApplication</code> found in gdx-backends-robovm.jar)</li>
 * </ul>
 * Each application class has it's own startup and initialization methods. Please refer to their documentation for more
 * information.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * While game programmers are used to having a main loop, libgdx employs a different concept to accommodate the event based nature
 * of Android applications a little more. You application logic must be implemented in a {@link ApplicationListener} which has
 * methods that get called by the Application when the application is created, resumed, paused, disposed or rendered. As a
 * developer you will simply implement the ApplicationListener interface and fill in the functionality accordingly. The
 * ApplicationListener is provided to a concrete Application instance as a parameter to the constructor or another initialization
 * method. Please refer to the documentation of the Application implementations for more information. Note that the
 * ApplicationListener can be provided to any Application implementation. This means that you only need to write your program
 * logic once and have it run on different platforms by passing it to a concrete Application implementation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The Application interface provides you with a set of modules for graphics, audio, input and file i/o.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Graphics} offers you various methods to output visuals to the screen. This is achieved via OpenGL ES 2.0 or 3.0
 * depending on what's available an the platform. On the desktop the features of OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0 are emulated via desktop
 * OpenGL. On Android the functionality of the Java OpenGL ES bindings is used.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Audio} offers you various methods to output and record sound and music. This is achieved via the Java Sound API on the
 * desktop. On Android the Android media framework is used.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Input} offers you various methods to poll user input from the keyboard, touch screen, mouse and accelerometer.
 * Additionally you can implement an {@link InputProcessor} and use it with {@link Input#setInputProcessor(InputProcessor)} to
 * receive input events.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Files} offers you various methods to access internal and external files. An internal file is a file that is stored near
 * your application. On Android internal files are equivalent to assets. On the desktop the classpath is first scanned for the
 * specified file. If that fails then the root directory of your application is used for a look up. External files are resources
 * you create in your application and write to an external storage. On Android external files reside on the SD-card, on the
 * desktop external files are written to a users home directory. If you know what you are doing you can also specify absolute file
 * names. Absolute filenames are not portable, so take great care when using this feature.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Net} offers you various methods to perform network operations, such as performing HTTP requests, or creating server and
 * client sockets for more elaborate network programming.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Application</code> also has a set of methods that you can use to query specific information such as the operating
 * system the application is currently running on and so forth. This allows you to have operating system dependent code paths. It
 * is however not recommended to use this facilities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The <code>Application</code> also has a simple logging method which will print to standard out on the desktop and to logcat on
 * Android.
 * </p>
