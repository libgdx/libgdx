/**
 * Provides methods to perform networking operations, such as simple HTTP get and post
 * requests, and TCP server/client socket communication.</p> 
 * 
 * To perform an HTTP Get or Post request, invoke the methods {@link #httpGet(String, String...)}
 * and {@link #httpPost(String, String, byte[])}. Both methods return a {@link HttpResult} which
 * provides methods to query the progress and data returned by the operations. The {@link HttpResult}
 * works like a {@link Future} in that the operation is executed asynchronously, while the API client
 * can use the {@link HttpResult} to poll for the status and result of the operation.</p>
 * 
 * To create a TCP client socket to communicate with a remote TCP server, invoke the {@link #newClientSocket(Protocol, String, int, SocketHints)}
 * method. The returned {@link Socket} offers an {@link InputStream} and {@link OutputStream} to
 * communicate with the end point.</p>
 * 
 * To create a TCP server socket that waits for incoming connections, invoke the {@link #newServerSocket(Protocol, int, ServerSocketHints)}
 * method. The returned {@link ServerSocket} offers an {@link ServerSocket#accept(SocketHints options)} method
 * that waits for an incoming connection.
