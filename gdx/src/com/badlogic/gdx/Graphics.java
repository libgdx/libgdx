/**
 * <p>
 * This interface encapsulates the communication with the graphics processor. It allows to retrieve {@link GL10}, {@link GL11} and
 * {@link GL20} instances depending on the available hardware and configuration of the {@link Application}. Additionally it
 * features methods to generate {@link Pixmap}s and {@link Texture}s.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * {@link Texture}s can be either managed or not managed. Managed and Textures will be restored when the OpenGL context is lost.
 * An OpenGL ES context loss happens when a user pauses the Application ( {@link ApplicationListener#pause()}) and switches to
 * another application on Android. On the desktop there is no concept of context loss for OpenGL.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are many more utility classes that are not directly generated by the {@link Graphics} interfaces. See {@link VertexArray}, {@link VertexBufferObject}, {@link IndexBufferObject}, {@link Mesh}, {@link ShaderProgram} and {@link FrameBuffer},
 * {@link BitmapFont}, {@link SpriteBatch} and so on. All these classes are managed, meaning they don't need to be reloaded on a
 * context loss. Explore the com.badlogic.gdx.graphics package for more classes that might come in handy.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * All graphical resources, be the generated by the {@link Graphics} interface or via a constructor <b>must</b> be disposed when
 * no longer used!
 * </p>
