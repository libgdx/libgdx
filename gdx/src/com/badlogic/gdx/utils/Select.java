/** This class is for selecting a ranked element (kth ordered statistic) from an unordered list in faster time than sorting the
 * whole array. Typical applications include finding the nearest enemy unit(s), and other operations which are likely to run as
 * often as every x frames. Certain values of k will result in a partial sorting of the Array.
 * <p>
 * The lowest ranking element starts at 1, not 0. 1 = first, 2 = second, 3 = third, etc. calling with a value of zero will result
 * in a {@link GdxRuntimeException}
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class uses very minimal extra memory, as it makes no copies of the array. The underlying algorithms used are a naive
 * single-pass for k=min and k=max, and Hoare's quickselect for values in between.
 * </p>
