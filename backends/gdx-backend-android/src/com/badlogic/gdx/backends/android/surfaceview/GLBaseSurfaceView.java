/**
 * An implementation of SurfaceView that uses the dedicated surface for
 * displaying OpenGL rendering.
 * <p>
 * A GLSurfaceView provides the following features:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Manages a surface, which is a special piece of memory that can be
 * composited into the Android view system.
 * <li>Manages an EGL display, which enables OpenGL to render into a surface.
 * <li>Accepts a user-provided Renderer object that does the actual rendering.
 * <li>Renders on a dedicated thread to decouple rendering performance from the
 * UI thread.
 * <li>Supports both on-demand and continuous rendering.
 * <li>Optionally wraps, traces, and/or error-checks the renderer's OpenGL calls.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Using GLSurfaceView</h3>
 * <p>
 * Typically you use GLSurfaceView by subclassing it and overriding one or more of the
 * View system input event methods. If your application does not need to override event
 * methods then GLSurfaceView can be used as-is. For the most part
 * GLSurfaceView behavior is customized by calling "set" methods rather than by subclassing.
 * For example, unlike a regular View, drawing is delegated to a separate Renderer object which
 * is registered with the GLSurfaceView
 * using the {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)} call.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Initializing GLSurfaceView</h3>
 * All you have to do to initialize a GLSurfaceView is call {@link #setRenderer(Renderer)}.
 * However, if desired, you can modify the default behavior of GLSurfaceView by calling one or
 * more of these methods before calling setRenderer:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #setDebugFlags(int)}
 * <li>{@link #setEGLConfigChooser(boolean)}
 * <li>{@link #setEGLConfigChooser(EGLConfigChooser)}
 * <li>{@link #setEGLConfigChooser(int, int, int, int, int, int)}
 * <li>{@link #setGLWrapper(GLWrapper)}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Choosing an EGL Configuration</h4>
 * A given Android device may support multiple possible types of drawing surfaces.
 * The available surfaces may differ in how may channels of data are present, as
 * well as how many bits are allocated to each channel. Therefore, the first thing
 * GLSurfaceView has to do when starting to render is choose what type of surface to use.
 * <p>
 * By default GLSurfaceView chooses an available surface that's closest to a 16-bit R5G6B5 surface
 * with a 16-bit depth buffer and no stencil. If you would prefer a different surface (for example,
 * if you do not need a depth buffer) you can override the default behavior by calling one of the
 * setEGLConfigChooser methods.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Debug Behavior</h4>
 * You can optionally modify the behavior of GLSurfaceView by calling
 * one or more of the debugging methods {@link #setDebugFlags(int)},
 * and {@link #setGLWrapper}. These methods may be called before and/or after setRenderer, but
 * typically they are called before setRenderer so that they take effect immediately.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Setting a Renderer</h4>
 * Finally, you must call {@link #setRenderer} to register a {@link Renderer}.
 * The renderer is
 * responsible for doing the actual OpenGL rendering.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Rendering Mode</h3>
 * Once the renderer is set, you can control whether the renderer draws
 * continuously or on-demand by calling
 * {@link #setRenderMode}. The default is continuous rendering.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Activity Life-cycle</h3>
 * A GLSurfaceView must be notified when the activity is paused and resumed. GLSurfaceView clients
 * are required to call {@link #onPause()} when the activity pauses and
 * {@link #onResume()} when the activity resumes. These calls allow GLSurfaceView to
 * pause and resume the rendering thread, and also allow GLSurfaceView to release and recreate
 * the OpenGL display.
 * <p>
 * <h3>Handling events</h3>
 * <p>
 * To handle an event you will typically subclass GLSurfaceView and override the
 * appropriate method, just as you would with any other View. However, when handling
 * the event, you may need to communicate with the Renderer object
 * that's running in the rendering thread. You can do this using any
 * standard Java cross-thread communication mechanism. In addition,
 * one relatively easy way to communicate with your renderer is
 * to call
 * {@link #queueEvent(Runnable)}. For example:
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 * class MyGLSurfaceView extends GLSurfaceView {
 *
 *     private MyRenderer mMyRenderer;
 *
 *     public void start() {
 *         mMyRenderer = ...;
 *         setRenderer(mMyRenderer);
 *     }
 *
 *     public boolean onKeyDown(int keyCode, KeyEvent event) {
 *         if (keyCode == KeyEvent.KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER) {
 *             queueEvent(new Runnable() {
 *                 // This method will be called on the rendering
 *                 // thread:
 *                 public void run() {
 *                     mMyRenderer.handleDpadCenter();
 *                 }});
 *             return true;
 *         }
 *         return super.onKeyDown(keyCode, event);
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
