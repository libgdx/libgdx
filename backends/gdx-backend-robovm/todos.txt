General
	- see issue tracker, RoboVM specific issues are marked with [RoboVM]
	- OGG is currently not supported by ObjectAL
	- Update: Vibration is not really supported on iOS
	
- IOSApplication.java
	- getClipboard() not implemented properly, should at least support strings
	
- IOSApplicationConfiguration
	- add compass
	
- IOSGraphics
	- need to store current device orientation for Input#getOrienation and consorts
	- implement non-continuous rendering
	
- IOSInput
	- getAzimuth(), getPitch(), getRoll(), getRotationMatrix() need to be implemented and output the same as android
	- see if we can programmatically show the keyboard and receive key events, if so map to gdx keycodes
	- getPlaceholderTextInput() needs to be implemented		
	- add compass support, fix up isPeripheralAvailable(), including onscreen keyboard stuff

- IOSAudio
	- newAudioDevice(), new AudioRecorder() not implemented
	
- IOSSound
	- add support for manipulating an already playing sound instance, seems to work through ALSource
	- add support for pitch shifting, not sure ObjectAL can do that
