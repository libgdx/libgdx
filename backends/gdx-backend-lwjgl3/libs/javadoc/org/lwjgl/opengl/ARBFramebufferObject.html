<div class="block">Native bindings to the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/framebuffer_object.txt">ARB_framebuffer_object</a> extension.
 
 <p>ARB_framebuffer_object is an extension intended to address the following goals:
 <ul>
 <li>Reflect FBO-related functionality found in the OpenGL 3.0 specification.</li>
 <li>Integrate multiple disjoint extensions into a single ARB extension. These extensions are:
 <ul>
 <li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/framebuffer_object.txt">EXT_framebuffer_object</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/framebuffer_blit.txt">EXT_framebuffer_blit</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/framebuffer_multisample.txt">EXT_framebuffer_multisample</a></li>
 <li><a href="http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/packed_depth_stencil.txt">EXT_packed_depth_stencil</a></li>
 </ul></li>
 <li>Where appropriate, relax some of the constraints expressed by previous FBO-related extensions. In particular the requirement of matching attachment
 dimensions and component sizes has been relaxed, to allow implementations the freedom to support more flexible usages where possible.</li>
 </ul>
 ARB_framebuffer_object defines an interface for drawing to rendering destinations other than the buffers provided to the GL by the window-system.</p>
 
 <p>In this extension, these newly defined rendering destinations are known collectively as "framebuffer-attachable images". This extension provides a
 mechanism for attaching framebuffer-attachable images to the GL framebuffer as one of the standard GL logical buffers: color, depth, and stencil.
 (Attaching a framebuffer-attachable image to the accum logical buffer is left for a future extension to define). When a framebuffer-attachable image is
 attached to the framebuffer, it is used as the source and destination of fragment operations as described in Chapter 4.</p>
 
 <p>By allowing the use of a framebuffer-attachable image as a rendering destination, this extension enables a form of "offscreen" rendering. Furthermore,
 "render to texture" is supported by allowing the images of a texture to be used as framebuffer-attachable images. A particular image of a texture object
 is selected for use as a framebuffer-attachable image by specifying the mipmap level, cube map face (for a cube map texture), and layer (for a 3D
 texture) that identifies the image. The "render to texture" semantics of this extension are similar to performing traditional rendering to the
 framebuffer, followed immediately by a call to CopyTexSubImage. However, by using this extension instead, an application can achieve the same
 effect, but with the advantage that the GL can usually eliminate the data copy that would have been incurred by calling <code>CopyTexSubImage</code>.</p>
 
 <p>This extension also defines a new GL object type, called a "renderbuffer", which encapsulates a single 2D pixel image. The image of renderbuffer can be
 used as a framebuffer-attachable image for generalized offscreen rendering and it also provides a means to support rendering to GL logical buffer types
 which have no corresponding texture format (stencil, accum, etc). A renderbuffer is similar to a texture in that both renderbuffers and textures can be
 independently allocated and shared among multiple contexts. The framework defined by this extension is general enough that support for attaching images
 from GL objects other than textures and renderbuffers could be added by layered extensions.</p>
 
 <p>To facilitate efficient switching between collections of framebuffer-attachable images, this extension introduces another new GL object, called a
 framebuffer object. A framebuffer object contains the state that defines the traditional GL framebuffer, including its set of images. Prior to this
 extension, it was the window-system which defined and managed this collection of images, traditionally by grouping them into a "drawable". The
 window-system API's would also provide a function (i.e., <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/system/windows/WGL.html#wglMakeCurrent(long,%20long)"><code>WGL.wglMakeCurrent(long, long)</code></a>, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/system/linux/GLX.html#glXMakeCurrent(long,%20long,%20long)"><code>GLX.glXMakeCurrent(long, long, long)</code></a>, aglSetDrawable, etc.) to bind a drawable with a GL
 context (as is done in the <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/WGLARBPbuffer.html" title="class in org.lwjgl.opengl"><code>WGL_ARB_pbuffer</code></a> extension). In this extension however, this functionality is subsumed by the GL and the GL provides
 the function BindFramebuffer to bind a framebuffer object to the current context. Later, the context can bind back to the window-system-provided
 framebuffer in order to display rendered content.</p>
 
 <p>Previous extensions that enabled rendering to a texture have been much more complicated. One example is the combination of <code>ARB_pbuffer</code> and
 <code>ARB_render_texture</code>, both of which are window-system extensions. This combination requires calling <code>MakeCurrent</code>, an operation that may be
 expensive, to switch between the window and the pbuffer drawables. An application must create one pbuffer per renderable texture in order to portably
 use <code>ARB_render_texture</code>. An application must maintain at least one GL context per texture format, because each context can only operate on a
 single pixelformat or <code>FBConfig</code>. All of these characteristics make <code>ARB_render_texture</code> both inefficient and cumbersome to use.</p>
 
 <p>ARB_framebuffer_object, on the other hand, is both simpler to use and more efficient than ARB_render_texture. The ARB_framebuffer_object API is
 contained wholly within the GL API and has no (non-portable) window-system components. Under ARB_framebuffer_object, it is not necessary to create a
 second GL context when rendering to a texture image whose format differs from that of the window. Finally, unlike the pbuffers of
 <code>ARB_render_texture</code>, a single framebuffer object can facilitate rendering to an unlimited number of texture objects.</p>
 
 <p>This extension differs from EXT_framebuffer_object by splitting the framebuffer object binding point into separate DRAW and READ bindings (incorporating
 functionality introduced by EXT_framebuffer_blit). This allows copying directly from one framebuffer to another. In addition, a new high performance
 blit function is added to facilitate these blits and perform some data conversion where allowed.</p>
 
 <p>This extension also enables usage of multisampling in conjunction with renderbuffers (incorporating functionality from EXT_packed_depth_stencil), as
 follows:</p>
 
 <p>The new operation RenderbufferStorageMultisample() allocates storage for a renderbuffer object that can be used as a multisample buffer. A multisample
 render buffer image differs from a single-sample render buffer image in that a multisample image has a number of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_SAMPLES"><code>SAMPLES</code></a> that is greater than zero.
 No method is provided for creating multisample texture images.</p>
 
 <p>All of the framebuffer-attachable images attached to a framebuffer object must have the same number of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_SAMPLES"><code>SAMPLES</code></a> or else the framebuffer object is
 not "framebuffer complete". If a framebuffer object with multisample attachments is "framebuffer complete", then the framebuffer object behaves as if
 <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS"><code>SAMPLE_BUFFERS</code></a> is one.</p>
 
 <p>In traditional multisample rendering, where <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING"><code>DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING</code></a> is zero and <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS"><code>SAMPLE_BUFFERS</code></a> is one, the GL spec states that "the color sample
 values are resolved to a single, displayable color each time a pixel is updated." There are, however, several modern hardware implementations that do
 not actually resolve for each sample update, but instead postpones the resolve operation to a later time and resolve a batch of sample updates at a
 time. This is OK as long as the implementation behaves "as if" it had resolved a sample-at-a-time. Unfortunately, however, honoring the "as if" rule can
 sometimes degrade performance.</p>
 
 <p>In contrast, when <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING"><code>DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING</code></a> is an application-created framebuffer object, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_MULTISAMPLE"><code>MULTISAMPLE</code></a> is enabled, and <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_SAMPLE_BUFFERS"><code>SAMPLE_BUFFERS</code></a> is one,
 there is no implicit per-sample-update resolve. Instead, the application explicitly controls when the resolve operation is performed. The resolve
 operation is affected by calling BlitFramebuffer where the source is a multisample application-created framebuffer object and the destination is a
 single-sample framebuffer object (either application-created or window-system provided).</p>
 
 <p>This design for multisample resolve more closely matches current hardware, but still permits implementations which choose to resolve a single sample at
 a time. If hardware that implements the multisample resolution "one sample at a time" exposes ARB_framebuffer_object, it could perform the implicit
 resolve to a driver-managed hidden surface, then read from that surface when the application calls BlitFramebuffer.</p>
 
 <p>Another motivation for granting the application explicit control over the multisample resolve operation has to do with the flexibility afforded by
 ARB_framebuffer_object. Previously, a drawable (window or pbuffer) had exclusive access to all of its buffers. There was no mechanism for sharing a
 buffer across multiple drawables. Under ARB_framebuffer_object, however, a mechanism exists for sharing a framebuffer-attachable image across several
 framebuffer objects, as well as sharing an image between a framebuffer object and a texture. If we had retained the "implicit" resolve from traditional
 multisampled rendering, and allowed the creation of "multisample" format renderbuffers, then this type of sharing would have lead to two problematic
 situations:
 <ul>
 <li>Two contexts, which shared renderbuffers, might perform competing resolve operations into the same single-sample buffer with ambiguous results.</li>
 <li>It would have introduced the unfortunate ability to use the single-sample buffer as a texture while <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL13.html#GL_MULTISAMPLE"><code>MULTISAMPLE</code></a> is enabled.</li>
 </ul></p>
 
 <p>Using <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#glBlitFramebuffer(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)"><code>BlitFramebuffer</code></a> as an explicit resolve to serialize access to the multisampled contents and eliminate the implicit per-sample resolve operation, we avoid both of these problems.</p>
 
 <p>This extension also enables usage of packed depth-stencil formats in renderbuffers (incorporating functionality from EXT_packed_depth_stencil), as
 follows:</p>
 
 <p>Many OpenGL implementations have chosen to interleave the depth and stencil buffers into one buffer, often with 24 bits of depth precision and 8 bits of
 stencil data. 32 bits is more than is needed for the depth buffer much of the time; a 24-bit depth buffer, on the other hand, requires that reads and
 writes of depth data be unaligned with respect to power-of-two boundaries. On the other hand, 8 bits of stencil data is more than sufficient for most
 applications, so it is only natural to pack the two buffers into a single buffer with both depth and stencil data. OpenGL never provides direct access
 to the buffers, so the OpenGL implementation can provide an interface to applications where it appears the one merged buffer is composed of two logical buffers.</p>
 
 <p>One disadvantage of this scheme is that OpenGL lacks any means by which this packed data can be handled efficiently. For example, when an application
 reads from the 24-bit depth buffer, using the type <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT"><code>UNSIGNED_SHORT</code></a> will lose 8 bits of data, while <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_UNSIGNED_INT"><code>UNSIGNED_INT</code></a> has 8 too many. Both require
 expensive format conversion operations. A 24-bit format would be no more suitable, because it would also suffer from the unaligned memory accesses that
 made the standalone 24-bit depth buffer an unattractive proposition in the first place.</p>
 
 <p>Many applications, such as parallel rendering applications, may also wish to draw to or read back from both the depth and stencil buffers at the same
 time. Currently this requires two separate operations, reducing performance. Since the buffers are interleaved, drawing to or reading from both should
 be no more expensive than using just one; in some cases, it may even be cheaper.</p>
 
 <p>This extension provides a new data format, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a>, that can be used with the <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glDrawPixels(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20java.nio.ByteBuffer)"><code>DrawPixels</code></a>, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glReadPixels(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20java.nio.ByteBuffer)"><code>ReadPixels</code></a>, and <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glCopyPixels(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)"><code>CopyPixels</code></a>
 commands, as well as a packed data type, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8"><code>UNSIGNED_INT_24_8</code></a>, that is meant to be used with <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a>. No other data types are supported with
 <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a>. If <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBDepthTexture.html" title="class in org.lwjgl.opengl"><code>ARB_depth_texture</code></a> or SGIX_depth_texture is supported, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a>/<a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_UNSIGNED_INT_24_8"><code>UNSIGNED_INT_24_8</code></a> data can also be used for textures;
 this provides a more efficient way to supply data for a 24-bit depth texture.</p>
 
 <p><a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data, when passed through the pixel path, undergoes both depth and stencil operations. The depth data is scaled and biased by the current
 <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_DEPTH_SCALE"><code>DEPTH_SCALE</code></a> and <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_DEPTH_BIAS"><code>DEPTH_BIAS</code></a>, while the stencil data is shifted and offset by the current <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_INDEX_SHIFT"><code>INDEX_SHIFT</code></a> and <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_INDEX_OFFSET"><code>INDEX_OFFSET</code></a>. The stencil
 data is also put through the stencil-to-stencil pixel map.</p>
 
 <p><a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glDrawPixels(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20java.nio.ByteBuffer)"><code>DrawPixels</code></a> of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data operates similarly to that of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_STENCIL_INDEX"><code>STENCIL_INDEX</code></a> data, bypassing the OpenGL fragment pipeline entirely, unlike
 the treatment of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT"><code>DEPTH_COMPONENT</code></a> data. The stencil and depth masks are applied, as are the pixel ownership and scissor tests, but all other
 operations are skipped.</p>
 
 <p><a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glReadPixels(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20java.nio.ByteBuffer)"><code>ReadPixels</code></a> of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data reads back a rectangle from both the depth and stencil buffers.</p>
 
 <p><a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glCopyPixels(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20int)"><code>CopyPixels</code></a> of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data copies a rectangle from both the depth and stencil buffers. Like glDrawPixels, it applies both the stencil and
 depth masks but skips the remainder of the OpenGL fragment pipeline.</p>
 
 <p>glTex[Sub]Image[1,2,3]D of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data loads depth and stencil data into a depth_stencil texture. <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#GetTexImage"><code>GL11.GetTexImage</code></a> of <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data can
 be used to retrieve depth and stencil data from a depth/stencil texture.</p>
 
 <p>In addition, a new base internal format, <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a>, can be used by both texture images and renderbuffer storage. When an image with a
 <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> internal format is attached to both the depth and stencil attachment points of a framebuffer object, then it becomes both the depth and
 stencil buffers of the framebuffer. This fits nicely with hardware that interleaves both depth and stencil data into a single buffer. When a texture
 with <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> data is bound for texturing, only the depth component is accessible through the texture fetcher. The stencil data can be written
 with TexImage or CopyTexImage, and can be read with <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/GL11.html#glGetTexImage(int,%20int,%20int,%20int,%20java.nio.ByteBuffer)"><code>GetTexImage</code></a>. When a <a href="../../../org/lwjgl/opengl/ARBFramebufferObject.html#GL_DEPTH_STENCIL"><code>DEPTH_STENCIL</code></a> image is attached to the stencil attachment of the bound
 framebuffer object, the stencil data can be accessed through any operation that reads from or writes to the framebuffer's stencil buffer.</p>
