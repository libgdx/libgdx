/** A buffer is a list of elements of a specific primitive type.
 * <p>
 * A buffer can be described by the following properties:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Capacity: the number of elements a buffer can hold. Capacity may not be negative and never changes.</li>
 * <li>Position: a cursor of this buffer. Elements are read or written at the position if you do not specify an index explicitly.
 * Position may not be negative and not greater than the limit.</li>
 * <li>Limit: controls the scope of accessible elements. You can only read or write elements from index zero to
 * <code>limit - 1</code>. Accessing elements out of the scope will cause an exception. Limit may not be negative and not greater
 * than capacity.</li>
 * <li>Mark: used to remember the current position, so that you can reset the position later. Mark may not be negative and no
 * greater than position.</li>
 * <li>A buffer can be read-only or read-write. Trying to modify the elements of a read-only buffer will cause a
 * <code>ReadOnlyBufferException</code>, while changing the position, limit and mark of a read-only buffer is OK.</li>
 * <li>A buffer can be direct or indirect. A direct buffer will try its best to take advantage of native memory APIs and it may
 * not stay in the Java heap, thus it is not affected by garbage collection.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Buffers are not thread-safe. If concurrent access to a buffer instance is required, then the callers are responsible to take
 * care of the synchronization issues.
 * </p>
