 * streams expect the {@link #flush()} method to be called before closing the stream, to ensure all data is actually written out.
 * <p>
 * This abstract class does not provide a fully working implementation, so it needs to be subclassed, and at least the
 * {@link #write(char[], int, int)}, {@link #close()} and {@link #flush()} methods needs to be overridden. Overriding some of the
 * non-abstract methods is also often advised, since it might result in higher efficiency.
 * <p>
 * Many specialized readers for purposes like reading from a file already exist in this package.
