Use `devspaces --help` to know about updated commands.


### Start Devspaces 

It is assumed that you opened a terminal in `devspaces` folder of the repository.

1.  Create DevSpaces.

```bash
devspaces create
```

2. Start your devspaces.
```bash
devspaces start libgdx
```

3. Start containers synchronization.

```bash
cd ..
devspaces bind libgdx
```
4. Grab some container info

```bash
devspaces info libgdx
```

5. Connect to development container

```bash
devspaces exec libgdx
```

6. Wait until source code will be synced and build the project. You may find out the sync status by openning `http://localhost:49152` in your browser.
 
```bash
./gradlew fetchNatives

```

7. You may run tests.

```bash
./gradlew tests:gdx-tests-android:installDebug
```

### Troubleshooting

1. By the moment of preparing this devspace `Dockerfile` was not building in DF Devspaces. However it was building fine locally. Therefore there is another dockerfile in `other` folder. Please use it in case you faced with devspaces build issues. You may start using it just by substituting this line in `devspaces.yml` file

```
...
docker-file: Dockerfile
...
```

to this one

```
...
docker-file: other/Dockerfile
...
```
