Breakout (Brix hack), by: David Winter

This game is an "arkanoid" precursor. You have 5 lives, and your goal is the destruction of all the brixs. Use 4 and 6 to move your paddle. The game ends when all the brixs are destroyed.

This game is the same than BRIX, but has graphics looking like the game on the Atari 2600 console.
