Pax Britannica uses git submodules to manage its framework dependencies. If you
downloaded this source copy from git, you need to type
    git submodule update --init
to initialize the framework before compiling.

To compile, use one of the following based on your platform:
Linux:   make linux
OS X:    make macosx
Windows: make mingw

Pax Britannica depends on lua 5.1 and glfw. On some systems you might need to
tell the build process where to find these. On Ubuntu, for example, the
liblua5.1-dev package installs lua as lua5.1, so you need to use
    make linux EXTRA_CFLAGS=-I/usr/include/lua5.1
and additionally change -llua in dokidoki-support/Makefile to -llua5.1

None of this is a problem if you installed lua from source ;)
