## Getting Started

Contributions to this repo are made via issues and pull requests (PRs). A few general guidelines that cover both: 

- Search for existing issues and PRs before creating your own.
- If you just need support with using libGDX, please ask on our [Discord](https://libgdx.com/community/discord/) server instead of opening an issue. 
- If you are unsure about something or want to discuss an idea, just head over to the `#libgdx-contributions` channel on our [Discord](https://libgdx.com/community/discord/), we are always happy to help!

If you are looking for areas to contribute in, scan through our [existing issues](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using `labels` as filters. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the library, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a PR is created. Before you report an issue on our  [issue tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues), we ask you to do a few things:

- Verify that the problem hasn’t already been reported on the tracker. If that is the case, please add your own information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help indicate that a particular problem is affecting more than just one user.
- Make sure the bug hasn’t already been fixed. Use the latest snapshot of libGDX to try to reproduce your issue.
- Create a concise, self-contained example to demonstrate the issue. If we can’t reproduce your issue, we can’t fix it.

Once you have done this, [create a new issue](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues/new) in the project and follow the instructions in the template that is shown to help us triage your issue.

### Pull Requests

PRs for libGDX are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, PRs should:

- Only fix/add _one_ thing.
- Add a meaningful description that explains what the PR does, what might still be missing (maybe testing on certain platforms?) and anything else potential reviewers need to know.

Before starting to contribute, please also give a quick look at our [Contributing Guidelines](https://libgdx.com/dev/contributing/#guidelines), in particular the sections on the Contributor License Agreement and Formatting. For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes, it's best to discuss your proposal first on our [Discord](https://libgdx.com/community/discord/) server (check the `#libgdx-contributions` channel). 

Now, let's see how you can actually create a PR:

1.  Fork the repository to your own Github account. Clone the project to your machine. Set up the project in your local IDE. These steps are detailed over on [our website](https://libgdx.com/dev/from-source/#setting-the-project-up).
2.  Create a branch locally with a concise but descriptive name
3.  Commit changes to the branch
4.  Push changes to your fork
5.  Open a PR in our repository

### Reviews

Pull requests need to be reviewed before they can be merged. If you see any PRs that interest you or that you would like to get into the next release, feel free to chime in! Reviews should focus on two things: (1.) does the PR work, (2.) are the code changes sensible. If you are testing things, please also state your platform (Windows, macOS, Android, etc.) if applicable.

The features we are currently focusing on for our next release are part of a [milestone](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/milestones). Check it out if you want to see which PRs are most in need of reviews!
