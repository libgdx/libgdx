## Cross-platform Game Development Framework
**[libGDX](https://libgdx.com) is a cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES), designed for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, web browsers, and iOS.** It provides a robust and well-established environment for rapid prototyping and iterative development. Unlike other frameworks, libGDX does not impose a specific design or coding style, allowing you the freedom to create games according to your preferences.
