## Cross-platform Game Development Framework
**[libGDX](https://libgdx.com) is a cross-platform Java game development framework based on OpenGL (ES) that works on Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS and your WebGL enabled browser.** It provides a well-tried and robust environment for rapid prototyping and fast iterations. LibGDX does not force a specific design or coding style on you, it rather gives you the freedom to create a game the way you like it.

## Open Source, Feature Packed and Offering a Big Third-Party Ecosystem
libGDX is licensed under [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) meaning you can use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects. We, however, love to get (non-mandatory) credit in case you release a game or app using libGDX! See our [showcase](https://libgdx.com/showcase/) for a selection of some popular libGDX games. libGDX comes with [batteries included](https://libgdx.com/features/) and provides everything required to develop multi-platform 2D and 3D games with Java.

libGDX also offers a very extensive third-party ecosystem. There are numerous [tools](https://libgdx.com/dev/tools/) and libraries that take a lot of work off the hands of developers. Take a look at [awesome-libgdx](https://github.com/rafaskb/awesome-libgdx#readme) for a curated list of libGDX-centered libraries and a good starting point for anyone new in the libGDX world.

## Getting libGDX / Documentation
As we switched to Gradle, there's no need to download libGDX itself anymore: this can all be done by your favorite build tool. We also offer a [setup tool](https://libgdx.com/dev/#how-to-get-started-with-libgdx), which automatically creates a project for you and downloads everything necessary. See our **[website](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/)** for instructions on how to get started with this or read our **[wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki)**.

- [Creating a libGDX Project](https://libgdx.com/dev/setup/)
- [A Simple Game](https://libgdx.com/dev/simple_game/)
- [Tutorials & Demos](https://libgdx.com/dev/tutorials/)

We also provide [javadocs](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/) online. The javadocs are also bundled as source Jars with every libGDX distribution for consumption in your favorite IDE.

## Community & Contributing
You can follow the **latest news** about libGDX on our [blog](https://libgdx.com/news/). Another good way to get in touch with our community is to join the official [libGDX Discord](https://libgdx.com/community/discord/).

### Reporting Issues
Use the **[Issue Tracker](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/issues)** here on GitHub to report issues. Please make sure you read the [Getting Help](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Getting-help) article that walks you through the process of properly reporting an issue.

### Working on the Code
libGDX has a strong developer community constantly improving the code base. We love to get any and all help we can. Our [Contributing Guidelines](https://libgdx.com/dev/contributing/) describe the process of helping libGDX to become even better. To contribute, you need to work with libGDX' sources directly, something normal users do not have to go through. The [Working with the Source](https://libgdx.com/dev/from_source/) article will give you some directions.

You can also contribute financially to our infrastructure (build server, web server, test devices) via our [Patreon](https://patreon.com/libgdx)!

### Supported By
libGDX is supported by helpful 3rd parties via code contributions, free licenses, test devices and so forth. Make our supporters happy and visit their sites!
