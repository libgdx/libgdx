## Compiling the Code

Be sure to understand the [prerequisites][7] required for Libgdx.

See [Running Demos &
Tests][8] for
instructions on getting the basics working with the source tree.

See the [Source Building wiki page][9] for instructions on building
native code and building distribution images.

You do not have to compile Libgdx, you can [download][A] official
releases and nightly build snapshots from [libgdx.badlogicgames.com][A].

## Libgdx Usage Examples

There are a number of example games included in the source. Some of them include:

 - metagun
 - superjumper
 - gdx-vertorpinball
 - rtm
 - very angry robots
 - pax-britannica

To see how to use libgdx you can either go to the [wiki][4] (which has plenty of good information) or read through
these example projects.  The test cases in `tests/gdx-tests/` are another good source of sample code.
Once again, if you get stuck just drop in to the friendly [forums][5].
