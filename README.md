## Compiling the Code

This project has a few [prerequisites][7] but primarily uses the ant build tool. If you wish to compile the code then just check it out and:

    cd /path/to/libgdx
    ant

And it should compile.

## Examples

There are a number of example games in the source. Some of them include:

 - metagun
 - superjumper
 - gdx-vertorpinball
 - rtm
 - very angry robots

To see how to use libgdx you can either go to the [wiki][4] (which has plenty of good information) or read through
these example projects. Once again, if you get stuck just drop in to the friendly [forums][5].
