TODO:
	- port RopeJoint test http://code.google.com/p/box2d/source/browse/trunk/Box2D/Testbed/Tests/RopeJoint.h?spec=svn149&r=149
	- BodyTypes test seems to be broken.	
	- shape hit, overlap and raycasting tests, could be used for all 2D intersection/overlap testing in libgdx. -> new class in math, uses box2d internally
