2013-11-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
  * New cameras supported
     Leica C, X VARIO
     Nikon D5300, D610, Df, 1 AW1
     Nokia Lumia 1020, 1520
     Olympus STYLUS1
     Pentax K-3
     Sony RX10, A3000 (ILCE-3000), 
  * Color data updated:
     Canon S120
     Nikon P7800, 1 J3
     Olympus E-M1
  * Corrected image visible area sizes
    Canon G16
    Sigma pre-Merrill cameras: small and medium-sized RAWs

  * Better EXIF parsing:
     - ISO values for new Nikon cameras (D4, D800)
     - black level extraction for Nikon D5300
     - correct Olympus color data conversion

  * Better Visual Studio compatibility (esp. old versions)
  * Cmake build: added ws2_32 library for MinGW builds
  * LibRaw 0.16.0-Beta1

2013-10-22 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
  * Support for new cameras:
    Sony A7, A7R
    Panasonic GM1

  * Sony RX1R and RX100M2 color data updated.

  * Sony cameras model name is set by SonyModelID EXIF tag
  
  * Sony ARW2: black level and color matrix extracted from EXIF data

  * Samsung: black level and color matrix extracted from EXIF; 
    Camera multipliers are now extracted correctly even if black is not 0

  * Better source compatibility with Mac OS X compilation

  * Better source compatibility with Win32 compilation

  * DNG without Compression tag assumed uncompressed

  * Better X3F-tools based Foveon support:
    - new Foveon metadata parser based on X3F-tools. So, if LibRaw compiled
      without demosaic-pack-GPL2, then no dcraw Foveon code used.
    - Support for Medium resolution RAWs from DPx Merrill and SD1 cameras.
      RAW data extracted as is (4800x1600 pixels), aspect ratio is set to
      0.5, so these RAWs are processed to full-size 4800x3200 RGB.
    - Support for Foveon thumbnail extraction. Only JPEG and bitmap
      thumbnails extracted, but 'foveon' (RAW) thumbnails are really not used
      in production cameras.
    - New imgdata.params.force_foveon_x3f flag
      Forces use of x3f-tools based code for Foveon processing if LibRaw
      compiled with demosaic-pack-GPL2 (and does nothing if LibRaw compiled
      without this pack).
      New flag -disadcf added to dcraw_emu sample to use this flag.
    - LibRaw do not calls exit() on broken Foveon files.

  * API/ABI changed, so all code using LibRaw should be recompiled.

  * LibRaw 0.16.0-Alpha3

  * Support for Foveon sensor based on X3F code by Roland Karlsson
    BSD-like license, so included in main LibRaw code.
    No 'foveon intepolation', so no way to get good colors from
    old Sigma cameras (SD9, SD14, Polaroid x530). For modern Foveon cameras
    one may try to create ICC profile (not supplied).

    TODO: thumbnail extraction, fast cancelation    

    Old foveon_*_load_raw (from dcraw) code is used if compiled with 
    LIBRAW_DEMOSAIC_PACK_GPL2

  * API Changes:

    + New parameters in imgdata.params:
      - imgdata.params.no_interpolation - disables interpolation step in 
        LibRaw::dcraw_process() call.
      - imgdata.params.no_auto_scale - disables call to scale_colors() in
        LibRaw::dcraw_process() call.
      - imgdata.params.sraw_ycc - disables Canon sRAW YCbCr to RGB conversion
        in LibRaw::unpack() call (use for RAW analyzers 

    + New Fuji X-Trans handling:

      - imgdata.iparams.xtrans[6][6] matrix contains row/col to color mapping
        for Fuji X-Trans sensor.

    + LibRaw::setCancelFlag() - use for fast decoder termination

    + LibRaw_abstract_datastream::make_byte_buffer() call is not needed more.

    + New demosaic code: DHT Demosaic by Anton Petrusevich
      Set params.user_qual=11 to use.

    + New demosaic code: Modified AHD Demosaic by Anton Petrusevich
      Set params.user_qual=12 to use.

    + New C-API call libraw_COLOR(libraw_data_t *t, int row,int col)
      (so LibRaw::COLOR(row,col) exposed to C-API users)

  * Removed faster lossless jpeg decoder ported from RawSpeed library
    some years ago. Build LibRaw with RawSpeed to get fast decoding.

  * Fixed decoding error for some Canon sRAW files.

  * Disabled RawSpeed's bad pixel processing if RawSpeed used.

2011-08-11 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * Imported dcraw 9.10 (1.444), support for new cameras added:
          ARRIRAW format, Canon SX30 IS, Leica D-LUX 5 and V-LUX2,
          Olympus E-P3, Panasonic G3 and GF3, Sony NEX-C3 and SLT-A35
          
        * Support for RedOne digital movie cameras (R3D format). 
          To enable this support you should:
           + install libjasper JPEG2000 support library

           + compile LibRaw with -DUSE_JASPER compiler switch (./configure
             will do it for you)

           + If you use own LibRaw_datastream implementation, you should
             implement make_jas_stream() call for your datastream. See
             bottom of src/libraw_cxx.cpp for  implementations in datafile
             and mem-buffer LibRaw streams.

        * Bugfix: green matching is turned off if output image is shrinked
          due to wavelet filtering or aberration correction.

        * fixed open_file()/adjust_sizes_info_only() code path

        * Removed imgdata.sizes.bottom_margin and right_margin data fields
          use imgdata.sizes.raw_width - width - left_margin to get right one,
          the same with bottom_margin.

        * minor ./configure cleanup
        
        * Qmake files and Visual Studio Project files are updated.

        * New version check macros:
          For use at runtime checks:
           LIBRAW_RUNTIME_CHECK_VERSION_EXACT() - checks  that runtime 
            major/minor version numbers are same with compile-time values.

           LIBRAW_RUNTIME_CHECK_VERSION_NOTLESS() - checks that runtime
            version is not less that compile-time one.

          For use at compile-time in preprocessor directives:
           LIBRAW_COMPILE_CHECK_VERSION_EXACT(major,minor) - Compile-time
            check that LibRaw version is exact major.minor.

           LIBRAW_COMPILE_CHECK_VERSION_NOTLESS(major,minor) - Compile-time
            check that version is not less than major.minor.

        * all client code should be recompiled due to internals change.

        * LibRaw 0.14.0-Alpha4

2011-07-19 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * New sample samples/postprocessing_benchmark.cpp
          This sample measures postprocessing speed.
          All demosaic methods, averaged white balance, median
          filtering, wavelet filtration, highlight recovery, and
          cropping are supported.

        * Removed LibRaw::rotate_fuji_raw() call and corresponding C-API call.

        * The LibRaw::adjust_sizes_info_only() call may be called repeated
          and mixed with dcraw_process() call.

        * Postprocessing speedup and optimization, especially if cropping set.

        * Cropping works for FujiCCD raws. For the technical reasons, the position
          of top-left corner of crop area will be rounded to the nearest
          multiple of 4 (the corner is shifted top-left).

        * LibRaw 0.14.0-Alpha3

2011-07-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * imported cropping code from 0.13 branch

2011-07-12 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * samples/multirender_test - check for different clip settings

2011-07-11 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * New call LibRaw::free_image(), deallocates imgdata.image buffer.
          Use this call if current postprocessing results are not
          needed, but it is to early to call recycle() because
          dcraw_process() may be called later.

        * New C-API calls
          libraw_raw2image() - C API for LibRaw::raw2image()
          libraw_free_image() - C API for LibRaw::free_image()
          libraw_get_decoder_info() - C API for LibRaw::get_decoder_info()

        * Bugfix: change of params.user_flip aftee open()/unpack()
          calls should work.

        * LibRaw 0.14.0-Alpha2

2011-07-10 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * Multiple rendering (LibRaw::dcraw_process() calls) allowed
          without re-opening RAW file thrfough the sequence of open()/unpack()
          calls.
          You should be able to change any processing parameters (except
          shot_select parameter) between dcraw_process() calls.

          + New sample in samples/multirender_test.cpp: renders data 4 times:
            in half and full modes with different white balance settings.

          + Unprocessed RAW data is stored in separate data buffer:
            (2 bytes per pixel for all Bayer-pattern images,
            8 bytes per pixel for Foveon, sRAW, and other full-color raw 
            formats), so now LibRaw uses 25% more memory for full processing of 
            most common Bayer images; while for just unpack memory is reduced 
            4 times.

          + New call LibRaw::raw2image() fills imgdata.image array
            with fresh copy of data.
            There is no need to call raw2image() separately if you use 
            dcraw_process() or dcraw_document_mode_processing() calls.

          + New call LibRaw::get_decoder_info() to determine raw data
            storage layout. See samples/unprocessed_raw.cpp for an example 
            of how to use it.

        If your code uses usual open()/unpack()/dcraw_process() call
        sequence, then NOTHING CHANGED: your program should produce same
        results. For interactive programs you may skip open()/unpack()
        calls after adjusting processing parameters, so user should see
        image refreshed much faster.

        If your code uses raw data (open+unpack calls), you need to call
        LibRaw::raw2image(), and imgdata.image will contain same bitmap
        as in LibRaw 0.13.x

        If you code uses access to masked borders data, you need to
        rewrite it. See samples/unprocessed_raw.cpp as a sample.

        Unfortunately, documentation is untouched yet. This problem will be
        fixed in next Alpha release.

        Other changes:

        * No separate imgdata.masked_pixels buffers, Bayer raw formats are read
          to buffer with borders. So, no ugly add_masked_border_to_bitmap()
          call.

        * No filtering_mode parameter. Raw tone curve is applied 
          at unpack() stage; zero pixels removed on postprocesing stage.

        * unprocessed_raw and 4colors samples are adjusted to use
          new RAW data storage layout.

        * all client code should be recompiled due to internals change.

        * LibRaw 0.14.0-Alpha1

2011-07-03 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
        * Cosmetic cleanup in Libraw_memmgr code

        * Permit OpenMP support on MS VS2008

        * More general mem_image interface:
          + New call get_mem_image_format returns bitmap size and bit depth
          + New call copy_mem_image can copy bitmap into buffer with 
            different color order (RGB/BGR) and line stride
          + dcraw_make_mem_image() uses calls mentioned above
          + see documentation for info on these function parameters.

        * libraw/librawwindows.h implements LibRaw_datastream class based
          on Windows memory mapped files.Win32/64-only 
          Thanks to Linc Brookes.

        * Fixed parallel make errors in configure/Makefile.am

2010-11-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

        * Several demosaic algorithms, found in other open-source RAW processing
          packages are implemented in LibRaw. 

          1) DCB demosaic and FBDD denoise by Jacek Gozdz are included in 
             main LibRaw source.
          2) GPL2 demosaic pack with these demosaic methods:
             * AFD and LMMSE implementations from PerfectRaw by Manuel Llorens
             * VCD, Modified AHD, post-demosaic refinemend and median
               filters by Paul Lee
          3) GPL3 demosaic pack with AMaZe interpolation  by Emil Martinec

          See more details in README.demosaic-packs
        
        * Current implementation of dcraw_emu sample allows only selection
          of demosaic method (via -q) options. All other parameters change
          will be implemented later.

           * fixed comment style in libraw_datastream.h
           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta6

2010-10-15 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * New changes to I/O layer. Three LibRaw_*datastream clasees are
             exists: 
               + LibRaw_buffer_datastream - buffer reaging
               + LibRaw_file_datastream - file reading using iostreams
                 (large files are no supported on some systems)
               + LibRaw_bigfile_datastream - FILE*-based file I/O

           *  file/bigfile_datastream is selected automatically by
              LibRaw::open_file based on input file size.
              By default, files larger than 250Mb are opened using
              bigfile interface, you may change this behaviour
              by using second optional parameter of open_file()

           * There is no way to use default parameter values in C API,
             so new call libraw_open_file_ex added with two parameters
             (file name and minimal file size for bigfile_datastream use).

           * all client code should be recompiled due to internals change.

           * All LibRaw_abstract_datastream functions are virtual again. You may
             (again) use your own I/O layer.

           * new -d key for dcraw_emu sample: print timings of processing stages

           * simple_dcraw sample simplified: no mmap code

           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta5

2010-10-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in exception handling in OpenMP sections in 
             AHD interpolation code.

           * LibRaw_datastreams are now C++ iostreams based instead of old
             plain FILE* calls.
             LibRaw::open_file() in multithreaded programs are WAY faster
             on many OSes (Linux, Windows, MacOSX) because of no extra locks.

           * all client code should be recompiled due to internals change.

           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta4


2010-10-01 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in LibRaw::dcraw_process() code: for half_size
             processing, params.four_color_rgb was set to 1 internally
             and not returned back after postprocessing.

           * Several Visual Studio 2003 compatibility fixes

            * AHD interpolation refactored. Now it is about 10% faster than
              dcraw in single-process mode and up to 1.5 times faster on
              4-core and OpenMP (total execution time counted, not AHD itself)
              Thanks to Adam Hooper
           * AHD interpolation refactored. Now it is about 10% faster than

             Thanks to Adam Hooper
              
           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta3

2010-09-07 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Phase One files: LibRaw::unpack() sets colordata.black to
             approximately correct value. 

           * Fixed minor error in setting colordata.maximum value
             for Phase One files.

           * LibRaw::subtract_black() sets colordata.black and
             colordata.cblack[] to zero to preserve data integrity.

           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta2
             

2010-09-04 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * It is now possible to crop output image on postprocessing
            stage (dcraw_process). Coordinates and size of the output box
            are set via imgdata.params.cropbox[4] parameter. Look into
            LibRaw documentation for more details.

              + New fatal error code LIBRAW_BAD_CROP

              + New dcraw_emu sample command line switch: -B x y w h
                (sets cropbox)

             Thanks to Patrick and Jan.

            * Processing pipeline has changed: the black level is subtracted
              from data on postprocessing stage either automatically 
              (on dcraw_process() stage) or by special LibRaw API call:

               + New API calls:  LibRaw::subtract_black() (C++ API) and
                 libraw_subtract_black (C API). 
                 If you use dcraw_process() or dcraw_document_mode_processing()
                 calls YOU DON'T NEED to call subtract_black() directly.
               
               + The raw preprocessing mode LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOBLACKS
                 is deprecated and removed from LibRaw.

             * New ./configure script.
               Use ./configure -h for usage details.
               Thanks to Siddhesh Poyarekar

             * New API cals static LibRaw::dcraw_clear_mem() (C++ API)
               and libraw_dcraw_clear_mem(..) (C API).
               This calls are used to free memory, allocated by
               dcraw_make_mem_image() and dcraw_make_mem_thumb() instead
               of free() call.

               In some cases LibRaw and calling process have different
               memory managers, so free() of make_mem_image() data 
               results to program crash (especially in Win32/VisualStudio
               enviroment).

             * LibRaw::free() is now private instead of public (again).

             * Minor changes and bugfixes:

               + Memory allocation exceptions (std::bad_alloc) are caught,
                 so LibRaw API calls will return reasonable error codes
                 instead of C++ exception (possibly unhandled).
                 This problem is very unlikely to see in wild: if application
                 cannot allocate small data for internal structure, it will 
                 always fail on allocation for RAW image data.

               + WIN32/VisualStudio 2008/2010: fopen,fscanf and sscanf calls
                 in Libraw_datastream code are changed to *_s (secure) ones.

               + Debug print removed from fatal error handler.

               + Mmaped I/O for dcraw_emu sample is turned on via -E switch
                 now (because old -B switch is used for settng cropbox).

           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size change
           
           * LibRaw 0.11-Beta1

              + OpenMP speedup  for PPG-interpolation
              + green_matching  - suppress of 'color maze' on cameras with
              different green channel sensitivity. This option is turns on
              by  filed with same name in imgdata.params
            
           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size 
             change

           * LibRaw 0.9.0-Beta4

2010-04-09 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * Fixed typecast error (problem reported only on gcc 4.2.1/32bit)
            in CRW files processing.

           * C++ API call LibRaw::adjust_maximum() is now deprecated and
             de-documented, use params.adjust_maximum_thr instead (on by default)

           *  C-API call libraw_adjust_maximum() removed.

           * New postprocessing parameter params.adjust_maximum_thr
             This parameter replaces LibRaw::adjust_maximum(), but more flexible
             Defaults are reasonable (0.75, same as in old adjust_maximum),
             look into documentation for more details.

           * Removed last OpenMP warning

           * dcraw_emu's -c parameter now wants numeric (float) argument. This value
             is assigned to params.adjust_maximum_thr.
             Use -c 0.0 for dcraw compatibility.

           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size 
             change

           * LibRaw 0.9.0-Beta3

           * Documented the -c command-line switch for dcraw_emu sample.
           * Removed extra messages from dcraw_emu sample.
           * LibRaw 0.9.0-Beta2

2010-03-28 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           
           New licensing:

           * Triple licensing (selected by LibRaw user):

              + LGPL 2.1 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-2.1.html)
              + CDDL 1.0 (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/cddl1.txt)
              + LibRaw Software License (27 March 2010 version)
               (http://www.libraw.org/data/LICENSE.LibRaw.pdf)

           * There is no separate LibRaw-Lite and LibRaw-Commercial versions,
             only single LibRaw.
             Current LibRaw-Lite and LibRaw-Commercial users should switch
             to LibRaw without loss of functionality.
             It is possible to change licensig too (e.g. from LGPL to CDDL
             for LibRaw-Lite users and from LibRaw License to LGPL or CDDL
             for LibRaw-Commercial users).

           * No Foveon support :(
             It is not possible to get good color from Foveon sensors with
             *any* converter. So, there is no need to support these cameras.
             Dcraw's Foveon-processing code is too strict licensed (GPL),
             so we choose to drop it.
             
           New Features:

           * New data field  colordata.channel_maximum[4] - per channel data
            maximum (calculated for most cameras, 0 for others).

           * New call LibRaw::adjust_maximum() (and libraw_adjust_maximum() in C API).
             This call changes hardcoded colordata.maximum value to calculated
             at unpack stage. This helps suppress false color in highlights
             (magenta clouds and so).

           * New command line parameter -c for dcraw_emu sample. Calls adjust_maximum()
             for each processed file.

           * all client code should be recompiled due to structures size 
             change

           * API changed: params.gamma_16bit field removed. Gamma curve is
             set via params.gamm[0]/gamm[1] values (see documentation and 
             samples for details)

           * Black level was not calculated for Canon RAWs in
             some filtering modes

           * 4channels sample prints calculated black level
             (scaled if autoscaling used). 
             Also output file names for this sample now includes 
             color channel name (R/G/B/G2 or C/M/Y/G)

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta2

2009-02-09 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * New sample 4channels: splits RAW color channels into four 
             separate TIFFs

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Beta1

           * Fixed bug in external jpeg metadata reading code.

           * Cleaned some C++ warnings

           * dcraw 8.91/1.418 imported
             + Hasselblad V96C support

           * You need to clean and recompile client code which
             uses LibRaw_*_datastream classes.

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha6

2009-01-30  Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>

           * New data input framework is created. It is possible now to
             easyly implement your own data input interface for LibRaw
             (e.g. for reading RAW data from network data stream)
             
           * All older programs using previous LibRaw versions are
	     compatible at source code level.

           * LibRaw can read RAW data from memory buffer via
             new LibRaw::open_buffer() API call (implemented on top of
             new input framework). 
             This call used in sample application dcraw_emu and simple_dcraw
             (with -B command-line switch) to test new API.

           * Error handling callback functions now can be called with
             NULL filename passed (if underlying data stream object
             does not know file name).
             So, client error handling callbacks should work with NULL
             filename.

           * All client code should be recompiled

           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.417:
              + Support for loading White Balance data from
                Sony ARW files edited with Sony IDC software.

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha5

2009-01-17 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Raw filtering mode LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOPOSTPROCESS has renamed
            to LIBRAW_FILTERING_NORAWCURVE for better reflect its purpose.
            This filtering_mode bit turns off tone curve applying on
            RAW data on bayer-pattern cameras with raw tone curve:
              + Adobe DNG (only RAW with bayer pattern)
              + Nikon compressed NEF
              + Some Kodak cameras
              + Sony A700/A900 (tone curve applied to 8-bit raws)

           * unprocessed_raw sample: added command-line key -N, this key
             turns on LIBRAW_FILTERING_NORAWCURVE filtering mode.

           * New scheme of Fuji RAW processing (introduced in 0.7-Alpha3)
             supports DNG files generated from Fuji RAF.
           
           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.416:
              + better support for Samsung S85
              + fixed possible integer overflow in wavelet denoising code

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha4


2009-01-14 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Black mask extraction supported for all files with bayer data
            (one component per pixel). Black mask data not avaliable
            for multi-component data (Foveon, Canon sRAW, Sinar 4-shot,
            Kodak YCC/YRGB).

           * Black level subtraction can be turned off for all bayer
            cameras (added support for PhaseOne backs).

           * Fujifilm camera processing model changed:
              + RAW data is extracted without 45-degree rotation
              + dcraw-compatible rotation is performed on postptocessing stage
              + it is possible to rotate RAW data without postprocessing
                by LibRaw::rotate_fuji_raw() call.

           * New filtering mode setting: LIBRAW_FILTERING_NOPOSTPROCESS
             This bits turns off RAW tone curve processing based on tone curve
             readed from RAW metadata.
             This mode supported only for PhaseOne backs now (to be supported
             on all relevant cameras in nearest future releases)

           * Black level data (got from RAW data) are stored for PhaseOne backs.

           * Black level subtraction bug (derived from dcraw) fixed
             for PhaseOne files.

           * Fixed processing of -s parameter for dcraw_emu sample
           
           * Parameter  -s N (select shot number) added to 
             unprocessed_raw sample.

           * Imported dcraw 8.90/1.414:
              + changes in QuickTake 100 metadata processing
              + changes in external jpeg processing code
              + Samsung S85 support

           * All client code should be recompiled

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha3 released

2009-01-10 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in add_masked_borders: crash if output dimensions
            is already larger than raw dimensions
            * Fixed out of bounds in samples/unprocessed_raw.cpp for files
            with non-square pixels

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha2 released
           
2009-01-08 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * Fixed bug in  0.7.0-a0: black frame size has not reset, 
             so in batch processing there is an error in black frame
             size for files without black frame.

           * Implemented reading of black/masked pixels data for 
             near all cameras with masked pixels, exclding:
              + Canon sRAW, Leaf (MOS), Sinar 4-shot - more than one 
                color component in black frame (redesign of black frame
                data structures required).
              + Fuji SuperCCD: need to design right methods of extraction 
                (should we rotate and resize black pixels as active ones??)

            * Tested for most dSLR data formats with masked pixels: 7 of 9
              untested formats are from old P&S cameras.

           * New call LibRaw::unpack_function_name() returns unpack function name
             (useful for testers only)

           * New identify sample parameters (useful for test-suite builders
             to check test coverage):
                  -u - print unpack function name
                  -f - print masked frame size
             These parameters works only for identify run without -v parameter

           * Imported dcraw 8.89/1.411
             + changes in Panasonic FZ50 files parsing

           * LibRaw 0.7.0-Alpha1 released


2009-01-05 Alex Tutubalin <lexa@lexa.ru>
           * It is possible to turn off RAW data filtration (black level 
             subtraction,              zero pixels averaging):
                + supported on all cameras except Foveon and Phase One
                + filtraction controlled by new parameter "filtering_mode"
                + it is possible to expand API by filtering procedures 
                  built for specific camera model.

           * Black border (masked pixels) extraction:
                + API (data structures) for storing black mask.
