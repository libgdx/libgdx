== Library for reading and processing of RAW digicam images ==

LibRaw is a library for reading RAW files from digital photo cameras 
(CRW/CR2, NEF, RAF, DNG, MOS, KDC, DCR, etc, virtually all RAW formats are 
supported). 

It pays special attention to correct retrieval of data required for subsequent 
RAW conversion.
    
The library is intended for embedding in RAW converters, data analyzers, and 
other programs using RAW files as the initial data.
