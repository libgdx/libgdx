ABOUT THE ILMBASE LIBRARIES 
----------------------------

Half is a class that encapsulates our 16-bit floating-point format.

IlmThread is a thread abstraction library for use with OpenEXR
and other software packages.  It currently supports pthreads and
Windows threads.

Imath implements 2D and 3D vectors, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices, quaternions
and other useful 2D and 3D math functions.

Iex is an exception-handling library.

If you have questions about using the IlmBase libraries, you may want
to join our developer mailing list.  See http://www.openexr.com for
details.


LICENSE
-------

The IlmBase source code distribution is free software.  See the file
named COPYING (included in this distribution) for details.


BUILDING ILMBASE
----------------

To build IlmBase on GNU/Linux or other UNIX-like systems, do this:

./configure
make
make install

unless you obtained IlmBase directly from CVS, in which case you
should first read README.CVS.

See README.OSX for details on building IlmBase in MacOS X.

Do `make check` to run the IlmBase confidence tests.  They should all
pass; if you find a test that does not pass on your system, please let
us know.

Other UNIX variants haven't been tested, but should be easy to build.
Let us know if you're having problems porting IlmBase to a particular
platform.

All include files needed to use the IlmBase libraries are installed in the 
OpenEXR subdirectory of the install prefix, e.g. /usr/local/include/OpenEXR.


USING ILMBASE IN YOUR APPLICATIONS
----------------------------------

On systems with support for pkg-config, use `pkg-config --cflags
IlmBase` for the C++ flags required to compile against IlmBase
headers; and `pkg-config --libs IlmBase` for the linker flags required
to link against IlmBase libraries.
