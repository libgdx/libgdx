Version 1.5.0:
    - Separated some of the code into other libraries - IlmBase and
      OpenEXR_Viewers - for easier integration with CTL.

Version 1.4.0a:
    - Fix for Visual Studio .NET 2003 ReleaseDLL builds.

Version 1.4.0:
    - Production release.
    - Bug fix for setFrameBuffer() on a tiled file.

Version 1.3.1:
    - Fixed the ReleaseDLL targets on Visual Studio 2005.
      
Version 1.3.0:
    - The 1.3.x series is a developer-only release for testing 
      OpenEXR's new multithreaded I/O support.
    - Multithread support for reading and writing an OpenEXR
      file.
    - Support for Intel-based OS X systems.
    - Support for Visual Studio 2005.
    - When compiling against OpenEXR headers, there's no longer any
      need to define any PLATFORM_* or HAVE_* macros; OpenEXR now
      supplies an OpenEXRConfig.h header file which is included by
      the OpenEXR headers that need these special macros.  However,
      on Windows platforms, when using OpenEXR DLLs, you must still
      define the OPENEXR_DLL preprocessor directive in your project.
    - New documentation for multithread support, plus some
      updates and additions.
    - Bug fixes releated to better handling of incomplete/damaged 
      files.
    - Numerous bug fixes and cleanups to the autoconf-based
      build system.
    - Removed support for the following configurations that were
      previously supported.  Some of these configurations may happen
      to continue to function, but we can't help you if they don't,
      largely because we don't have any way to test OpenEXR on these
      configurations.
      	   - IRIX 
      	   - OSF1
	   - SunOS
	   - OS X versions prior to 10.3.
	   - gcc on any platform prior to version 3.3

Version 1.2.2:
    - New build system for Windows; support for DLLs.
    - Imath: Removed TMatrix<T> classes; these classes are still
      under development and are too difficult to keep in sync
      with OpenEXR CVS.
    - IlmImf: support for image layers in ChannelList.
    - IlmImf: added isComplete() method to file classes to check
      whether a file is complete.
    - IlmImf: exposed staticInitialize() in ImfHeader.h in
      order to allow thread-safe library initialization in
      multithreaded applications.
    - IlmImf: New "time code" standard attribute.
    - exrdisplay: support for displaying wrap-around texture map
      images.
    - exrmaketiled: can now specify wrap mode.
    - IlmImf: New "wrapmodes" standard attribute to indicate
      extrapolation mode for mipmaps and ripmaps.
    - IlmImf: New "key code" standard attribute to identify motion
      picture film frames.

Version 1.2.1:
    - reduced memory footprint of exrenvmap and exrmaketiled 
      utilities.
    - IlmImf: new helper functions to determine whether a
      file is an OpenEXR file, and whether it's scanline- or
      tile-based.
    - IlmImf: bug fix for PXR24 compression with ySampling != 1.
    - Imath: a few new enhancements
    - Better support for gcc 3.4.
    - Warning cleanups in Visual C++.

Version 1.2:
    - Production-ready release.
    - Support for gcc 3.4.
    - Supports gcc 2.95 again.
    - IlmImf: bug fix for handling broken OpenEXR files without
      crashing.

Version 1.1.1:
    - Added Pixar's new "slightly lossy" image compression method
      for FLOAT channels, called PXR24.  HALF and UINT channels
      are compressed without loss.
    - Changed top-level LICENSE file to allow for other copyright
      holders for individual files.
    - Reading tiled files with the scanline interface is faster.
    - OpenEXR now supports YCA (luminance/chroma/alpha) images with
      subsampled chroma channels.
    - IlmImf: various bug fixes.
    - The half class is now faster in some expressions.
    - New tiled file format.  The new format is incompatible with
      the format used by 1.1.0.

Version 1.1.0:
    - IlmImfExamples: Updated to include examples of how to use
      the tiling and mip/ripmapping interfaces.
    - exrmakepreview: A new utility for embedding preview images
      in OpenEXR files.
    - exrenvmap: A new utility for creating OpenEXR environment maps.
    - exrstdattr: A new utility for manipulating standard attributes.
    - exrdisplay: Support for tiled, mip/ripmapped images, display
      windows, and preview images.
    - exrmaketiled: A new utility which generates tiled versions
      of OpenEXR images.
    - exrheader: Support for tiles, mipmaps, environment maps.
    - IlmImf: Support for environment maps.
    - IlmImf: Support for abstracted stream I/O.  You can
      wrap the IStream and OStream classes around your API
      of choice (FILE *, fd, even an HTTP 1.1 stream) as long
      as it supports seeking.
    - IlmImf: Support for tiled and mip/ripmapped files.  This
      requires a new file format.  Scanline files generated by
      the 1.1.0 version of the library can be read by older
      versions, but tiled files can only be read by 1.1.0 or
      greater.
    - Imath: added TMatrix*, generic 2D matricies and algorithms.
    - Imath: various updates and bug fixes.

Version 1.0.7:
    - Support for "optional standard" attributes:
	Primary and white point chromaticities.
	Absolute luminance.
	Content owner
	Comments
	Image acquisition time and place
	Focus distance
	Lens aperture
	Film sensitivity
      If you want to use these new attributes in your application, see
      ImfStandardAttributes.h for documentation on what they are and how
      to use them.
    - Bug fix in OpaqueAttributes.

Version 1.0.6:
    - Support for embedded preview images (thumbnails).
    - Automatic frame buffer type conversion.
    - Support for Visual Studio .NET 2003 w/ Microsoft's C++ compiler.

      systems.

      shaders.
    - Support for Win32 with Visual Studio 6.0 and Intel C++ compiler
      version 7.0.
    - Support for gcc 2.95.
    - New exrheader utility.
    - exrdisplay works on Win32 and OS X now.
