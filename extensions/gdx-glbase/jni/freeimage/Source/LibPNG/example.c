/* That's it ;-)  Of course you probably want to do more with PNG files than
 * just converting them all to 32-bit RGBA PNG files; you can do that between
 * the call to png_image_finish_read and png_image_write_to_file.  You can also
 * ask for the image data to be presented in a number of different formats.  You
 * do this by simply changing the 'format' parameter set before allocating the
 * buffer.
 *
 * The format parameter consists of five flags that define various aspects of
 * the image, you can simply add these together to get the format or you can use
 * one of the predefined macros from png.h (as above):
 *
 * PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_COLOR: if set the image will have three color components per
 *    pixel (red, green and blue), if not set the image will just have one
 *    luminance (grayscale) component.
 *
 * PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_ALPHA: if set each pixel in the image will have an additional
 *    alpha value; a linear value that describes the degree the image pixel
 *    covers (overwrites) the contents of the existing pixel on the display.
 *
 * PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_LINEAR: if set the components of each pixel will be returned
 *    as a series of 16-bit linear values, if not set the components will be
 *    returned as a series of 8-bit values encoded according to the 'sRGB'
 *    standard.  The 8-bit format is the normal format for images intended for
 *    direct display, because almost all display devices do the inverse of the
 *    sRGB transformation to the data they receive.  The 16-bit format is more
 *    common for scientific data and image data that must be further processed;
 *    because it is linear simple math can be done on the component values.
 *    Regardless of the setting of this flag the alpha channel is always linear,
 *    although it will be 8 bits or 16 bits wide as specified by the flag.
 *
 * PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_BGR: if set the components of a color pixel will be returned
 *    in the order blue, then green, then red.  If not set the pixel components
 *    are in the order red, then green, then blue.
 *
 * PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_AFIRST: if set the alpha channel (if present) precedes the
 *    color or grayscale components.  If not set the alpha channel follows the
 *    components.
 *
 * You do not have to read directly from a file.  You can read from memory or,
 * on systems that support it, from a <stdio.h> FILE*.  This is controlled by
 * the particular png_image_read_from_ function you call at the start.  Likewise
 * on write you can write to a FILE* if your system supports it.  Check the
 * macro PNG_STDIO_SUPPORTED to see if stdio support has been included in your
 * libpng build.
 *
 * If you read 16-bit (PNG_FORMAT_FLAG_LINEAR) data you may need to write it in
 * the 8-bit format for display.  You do this by setting the convert_to_8bit
 * flag to 'true'.
 *
 * Don't repeatedly convert between the 8-bit and 16-bit forms.  There is
 * significant data loss when 16-bit data is converted to the 8-bit encoding and
 * the current libpng implementation of convertion to 16-bit is also
 * significantly lossy.  The latter will be fixed in the future, but the former
 * is unavoidable - the 8-bit format just doesn't have enough resolution.
 */

/* If your program needs more information from the PNG data it reads, or if you
 * need to do more complex transformations, or minimise transformations, on the
 * data you read, then you must use one of the several lower level libpng
 * interfaces.
 *
 * All these interfaces require that you do your own error handling - your
 * program must be able to arrange for control to return to your own code any
 * time libpng encounters a problem.  There are several ways to do this, but the
 * standard way is to use the ANSI-C (C90) <setjmp.h> interface to establish a
 * return point within your own code.  You must do this if you do not use the
 * simplified interface (above).
 *
 * The first step is to include the header files you need, including the libpng
 * header file.  Include any standard headers and feature test macros your
 * program requires before including png.h:
