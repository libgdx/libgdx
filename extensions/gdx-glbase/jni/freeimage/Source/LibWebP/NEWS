- 12/19/13: version 0.4.0
  * improved gif2webp tool
  * numerous fixes, compression improvement and speed-up
  * dither option added to decoder (dwebp -dither 50 ...)
  * improved multi-threaded modes (-mt option)
  * improved filtering strength determination
  * New function: WebPMuxGetCanvasSize
  * BMP and TIFF format output added to 'dwebp'
  * Significant memory reduction for decoding lossy images with alpha.
  * Intertwined decoding of RGB and alpha for a shorter
    time-to-first-decoded-pixel.
  * WebPIterator has a new member 'has_alpha' denoting whether the frame
    contains transparency.
  * Container spec amended with new 'blending method' for animation.

- 6/13/13: version 0.3.1
  This is a binary compatible release.
  * Add incremental decoding support for images containing ALPH and ICCP chunks.
  * Python bindings via swig for the simple encode/decode interfaces similar to
    Java.

- 3/20/13: version 0.3.0
  This is a binary compatible release.
  * WebPINewRGB/WebPINewYUVA accept being passed a NULL output buffer
    and will perform auto-allocation.
  * default filter option is now '-strong -f 60'
  * encoding speed-up for lossy methods 3 to 6
  * alpha encoding can be done in parallel to lossy using 'cwebp -mt ...'
  * color profile, metadata (XMP/EXIF) and animation support finalized in the
    container.
  * various NEON assembly additions
  Tool updates / additions:
    * gif2webp added
    * vwebp given color profile & animation support
    * cwebp can preserve color profile / metadata with '-metadata'

- 10/30/12: version 0.2.1
  * Various security related fixes
  * cwebp.exe: fix import errors on Windows XP
  * enable DLL builds for mingw targets

- 8/3/12: version 0.2.0
  * Add support for ARGB -> YUVA conversion for lossless decoder
    New functions: WebPINewYUVA, WebPIDecGetYUVA
  * Add stats for lossless and alpha encoding
  * Security related hardening: allocation and size checks
  * Add PAM output support to dwebp

- 7/19/12: version 0.1.99
  * This is a pre-release of 0.2.0, not an rc to allow for further
    incompatible changes based on user feedback.
  * Alpha channel encode/decode support.
  * Lossless encoder/decoder.
  * Add TIFF input support to cwebp.
  Incompatible changes:
    * The encode ABI has been modified to support alpha encoding.
    * Deprecated function WebPINew() has been removed.
    * Decode function signatures have changed to consistently use size_t over
      int/uint32_t.
    * decode_vp8.h is no longer installed system-wide.
    * cwebp will encode the alpha channel if present.

- 9/19/11: version 0.1.3
  * Advanced decoding APIs.
  * On-the-fly cropping and rescaling of images.
  * SSE2 instructions for decoding performance optimizations on x86 based platforms.
  * Support Multi-threaded decoding.
  * 40% improvement in Decoding performance.
  * Add support for RGB565, RGBA4444 & ARGB image colorspace.
  * Better handling of large picture encoding.

- 3/25/11: version 0.1.2
  * Incremental decoding: picture can be decoded byte-by-byte if needs be.
  * lot of bug-fixes, consolidation and stabilization

- 2/23/11: initial release of version 0.1, with the new encoder
- 9/30/10: initial release version with only the lightweight decoder
