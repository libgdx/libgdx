<h1>SoundTouch audio processing library v1.7.0</h1>
<p class="normal">SoundTouch library Copyright © Olli Parviainen 2001-2012 </p>
<hr>
<h2>1. Introduction </h2>
<p>SoundTouch is an open-source audio processing library that allows
changing the sound tempo, pitch and playback rate parameters
independently from each other, i.e.:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Sound tempo can be increased or decreased while maintaining the
original pitch </li>
  <li> Sound pitch can be increased or decreased while maintaining the
original tempo </li>
  <li> Change playback rate that affects both tempo and pitch at the
same time </li>
  <li> Choose any combination of tempo/pitch/rate</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Compiling SoundTouch</h2>
<p>Before compiling, notice that you can choose the sample data format
if it's desirable to use floating point sample data instead of 16bit
integers. See section "sample data format" for more information.</p>
<h3>2.1. Building in Microsoft Windows</h3>
<p>Project files for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 and Visual C++ .NET are
supplied with the source code package.<br>
</p>
<p> Please notice that SoundTouch library uses processor-specific
optimizations for Pentium III and AMD processors. Visual Studio .NET
and later versions supports the required instructions by default, but
Visual Studio 6.0 requires a processor pack upgrade to be installed in
order to support these optimizations. The processor pack upgrade can be
downloaded from Microsoft site at this URL:</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx</a></p>
<p>If the above URL is unavailable or removed, go to <a
 href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/"> http://msdn.microsoft.com</a> and
perform a search with keywords "processor pack". </p>
<p>To build the binaries with Visual C++ compiler, either run
"make-win.bat" script, or open the appropriate project files in source
code directories with Visual Studio. The final executable will appear
under the "SoundTouch\bin" directory. If using the Visual Studio IDE
instead of the make-win.bat script, directories bin and lib may need to
be created manually to the SoundTouch package root for the final
executables. The make-win.bat script creates these directories
automatically. </p>
<h3>2.2. Building in Gnu platforms</h3>
<p>The SoundTouch library compiles in practically any platform
supporting GNU compiler (GCC) tools. SoundTouch requires GCC version 4.3 or later.</p>
<p>To build and install the binaries, run the following commands in 
/soundtouch directory:</p>
<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="4">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <pre>./bootstrap  -</pre>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Creates "configure" file with
local autoconf/automake toolset.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td>
      <pre>./configure  -</pre>
      </td>
      <td>
      <p>Configures the SoundTouch package for the local environment.
Notice that "configure" file is not available before running the
"./bootstrap" command as above.<br>
      </p>

<h4><b>2.2.1 Required GNU tools</b>&nbsp;</h4>
<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Bash shell</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">GNU C++ compiler</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">libtool</span>, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">autoconf</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">automake</span> tools
are required for compiling the SoundTouch library. These are usually
included with the GNU/Linux distribution, but if not, install these
packages first. For example, Ubuntu Linux can acquire and install
these with the following command:</p>
<pre><b>sudo apt-get install automake autoconf libtool build-essential</b></pre>
<h4><b>2.2.2 Problems with GCC compiler compatibility</b></h4>
<p>At the release time the SoundTouch package has been tested to
compile in GNU/Linux platform. However, If you have problems getting the
SoundTouch library compiled, try disabling optimizations that are specific for 
x86 processors by running <b>./configure</b> script with switch
<blockquote>
<pre>--enable-x86-optimizations=no</pre>
</blockquote>

Alternatively, if you don't use GNU Configure system, edit file "include/STTypes.h" 
directly and remove the following definition:<blockquote>
  <pre>#define SOUNDTOUCH_ALLOW_X86_OPTIMIZATIONS 1</pre>
</blockquote>

<hr>
<h2>3. About implementation &amp; Usage tips</h2>
<h3>3.1. Supported sample data formats</h3>
<p>The sample data format can be chosen between 16bit signed integer
and 32bit floating point values, the default is 32bit floating point. </p>
<p> In Windows environment, the sample data format is chosen in file
"STTypes.h" by choosing one of the following defines:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">#define
SOUNDTOUCH_INTEGER_SAMPLES</span> for 16bit signed integer </li>
  <li> <span style="font-weight: bold;">#define </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">SOUNDTOUCH_</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FLOAT_SAMPLES</span> for 32bit floating
point</li>
</ul>
<p> In GNU environment, the floating sample format is used by default,
but integer sample format can be chosen by giving the following switch
to the configure script: </p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>./configure --enable-integer-samples</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The sample data can have either single (mono) or double (stereo)
audio channel. Stereo data is interleaved so that every other data
value is for left channel and every second for right channel. Notice
that while it'd be possible in theory to process stereo sound as two
separate mono channels, this isn't recommended because processing the
channels separately would result in losing the phase coherency between
the channels, which consequently would ruin the stereo effect.</p>
<p>Sample rates between 8000-48000H are supported.</p>
<h3>3.2. Processing latency</h3>
<p>The processing and latency constraints of the SoundTouch library are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Input/output processing latency for the SoundTouch processor is
around 100 ms. This is when time-stretching is used. If the rate
transposing effect alone is used, the latency requirement is much
shorter, see section 'About algorithms'. </li>
  <li> Processing CD-quality sound (16bit stereo sound with 44100H
sample rate) in real-time or faster is possible starting from
processors equivalent to Intel Pentium 133Mh or better, if using the
"quick" processing algorithm. If not using the "quick" mode or if
floating point sample data are being used, several times more CPU power
is typically required.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3. About algorithms</h3>
<p>SoundTouch provides three seemingly independent effects: tempo,
pitch and playback rate control. These three controls are implemented
as combination of two primary effects, <em>sample rate transposing</em>
and <em>time-stretching</em>.</p>
<p><em>Sample rate transposing</em> affects both the audio stream
duration and pitch. It's implemented simply by converting the original
audio sample stream to the&nbsp; desired duration by interpolating from
the original audio samples. In SoundTouch, linear interpolation with
anti-alias filtering is used. Theoretically a higher-order
interpolation provide better result than 1st order linear
interpolation, but in audio application linear interpolation together
with anti-alias filtering performs subjectively about as well as
higher-order filtering would.</p>
<p><em>Time-stretching </em>means changing the audio stream duration
without affecting it's pitch. SoundTouch uses WSOLA-like
time-stretching routines that operate in the time domain. Compared to
sample rate transposing, time-stretching is a much heavier operation
and also requires a longer processing "window" of sound samples used by
the processing algorithm, thus increasing the algorithm input/output
latency. Typical i/o latency for the SoundTouch time-stretch algorithm
is around 100 ms.</p>
<p>Sample rate transposing and time-stretching are then used together
to produce the tempo, pitch and rate controls:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>'Tempo'</strong> control is implemented purely by
time-stretching. </li>
  <li> <strong>'Rate</strong>' control is implemented purely by sample
rate transposing. </li>
  <li> <strong>'Pitch</strong>' control is implemented as a
combination of time-stretching and sample rate transposing. For
example, to increase pitch the audio stream is first time-stretched to
longer duration (without affecting pitch) and then transposed back to
original duration by sample rate transposing, which simultaneously
reduces duration and increases pitch. The result is original duration
but increased pitch.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.4 Tuning the algorithm parameters</h3>
<p>The time-stretch algorithm has few parameters that can be tuned to
optimize sound quality for certain application. The current default
parameters have been chosen by iterative if-then analysis (read: "trial
and error") to obtain best subjective sound quality in pop/rock music
processing, but in applications processing different kind of sound the
default parameter set may result into a sub-optimal result.</p>
<p>The time-stretch algorithm default parameter values are set by the
following #defines in file "TDStretch.h":</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>#define DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS     AUTOMATIC<br>#define DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS   AUTOMATIC<br>#define DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS      8</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>These parameters affect to the time-stretch algorithm as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <strong>DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS</strong>: This is the default
length of a single processing sequence in milliseconds which determines
the how the original sound is chopped in the time-stretch algorithm.
Larger values mean fewer sequences are used in processing. In principle
a larger value sounds better when slowing down the tempo, but worse
when increasing the tempo and vice versa.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
By default, this setting value is calculated automatically according to
tempo value.<br>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>DEFAULT_SEEKWINDOW_MS</strong>: The seeking window
default length in milliseconds is for the algorithm that seeks the best
possible overlapping location. This determines from how wide a sample
"window" the algorithm can use to find an optimal mixing location when
the sound sequences are to be linked back together.&nbsp;<br>
    <br>
The bigger this window setting is, the higher the possibility to find a
better mixing position becomes, but at the same time large values may
cause a "drifting" sound artifact because neighboring sequences can be
chosen at more uneven intervals. If there's a disturbing artifact that
sounds as if a constant frequency was drifting around, try reducing
this setting.<br>
    <br>
By default, this setting value is calculated automatically according to
tempo value.<br>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>DEFAULT_OVERLAP_MS</strong>: Overlap length in
milliseconds. When the sound sequences are mixed back together to form
again a continuous sound stream, this parameter defines how much the
ends of the consecutive sequences will overlap with each other.<br>
    <br>
This shouldn't be that critical parameter. If you reduce the
DEFAULT_SEQUENCE_MS setting by a large amount, you might wish to try a
smaller value on this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that these parameters can also be set during execution time
with functions "<strong>TDStretch::setParameters()</strong>" and "<strong>SoundTouch::setSetting()</strong>".</p>
<p>The table below summaries how the parameters can be adjusted for
different applications:</p>

<h3>3.5 Performance Optimizations </h3>
<p><strong>General optimizations:</strong></p>
<p>The time-stretch routine has a 'quick' mode that substantially
speeds up the algorithm but may degrade the sound quality by a small
amount. This mode is activated by calling SoundTouch::setSetting()
function with parameter&nbsp; id of SETTING_USE_QUICKSEEK and value
"1", i.e. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>setSetting(SETTING_USE_QUICKSEEK, 1);</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>CPU-specific optimizations:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Intel MMX optimized routines are used with compatible CPUs when
16bit integer sample type is used. MMX optimizations are available both
in Win32 and Gnu/x86 platforms. Compatible processors are Intel
PentiumMMX and later; AMD K6-2, Athlon and later. </li>
  <li> Intel SSE optimized routines are used with compatible CPUs when
floating point sample type is used. SSE optimizations are currently
implemented for Win32 platform only. Processors compatible with SSE
extension are Intel processors starting from Pentium-III, and AMD
processors starting from Athlon XP. </li>
  <li> AMD 3DNow! optimized routines are used with compatible CPUs when
floating point sample type is used, but SSE extension isn't supported .
3DNow! optimizations are currently implemented for Win32 platform only.
These optimizations are used in AMD K6-2 and Athlon (classic) CPU's;
better performing SSE routines are used with AMD processor starting
from Athlon XP. </li>
</ul>

<p>SoundStretch audio processing utility<br>
    Copyright (c) Olli Parviainen 2002-2012</p>
<p>SoundStretch is a simple command-line application that can change
tempo, pitch and playback rates of WAV sound files. This program is
intended primarily to demonstrate how the "SoundTouch" library can be
used to process sound in your own program, but it can as well be used
for processing sound files.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> To use standard input/output pipes for processing, give "stdin"
and "stdout" as input/output filenames correspondingly. The standard
input/output pipes will still carry the audio data in .wav audio file
format. </li>
  <li> The numerical switches allow both integer (e.g. "-tempo=123")
and decimal (e.g. "-tempo=123.45") numbers. </li>
  <li> The "-naa" and/or "-quick" switches can be used to reduce CPU
usage while compromising some sound quality </li>
  <li> The BPM detection algorithm works by detecting repeating bass or
drum patterns at low frequencies of &lt;250Hz. A lower-than-expected
BPM figure may be reported for music with uneven or complex bass
patterns. </li>
</ul>
<h3>4.2. SoundStretch usage examples </h3>
<p><strong>Example 1</strong></p>
<p>The following command increases tempo of the sound file
"originalfile.wav" by 12.5% and stores result to file
"destinationfile.wav":</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>soundstretch originalfile.wav destinationfile.wav -tempo=12.5</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 2</strong></p>
<p>The following command decreases the sound pitch (key) of the sound
file "orig.wav" by two semitones and stores the result to file
"dest.wav":</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>soundstretch orig.wav dest.wav -pitch=-2</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 3</strong></p>
<p>The following command processes the file "orig.wav" by decreasing
the sound tempo by 25.3% and increasing the sound pitch (key) by 1.5
semitones. Resulting .wav audio data is directed to standard output
pipe:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>soundstretch orig.wav stdout -tempo=-25.3 -pitch=1.5</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 4</strong></p>
<p>The following command detects the BPM rate of the file "orig.wav"
and adjusts the tempo to match 100 beats per minute. Result is stored
to file "dest.wav":</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>soundstretch orig.wav dest.wav -bpm=100</pre>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example 5</strong></p>
<p>The following command reads .wav sound data from standard input pipe
and estimates the BPM rate:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>soundstretch stdin -bpm</pre>
</blockquote>

Earlier the MMX/SSE-optimized routines were written in
compiler-specific inline assembler, now these routines are migrated to
use compiler intrinsic syntax which allows compiling the same
MMX/SSE-optimized source code with both Visual C++ and GCC compilers. </li>
  <li> Set floating point as the default sample format and added switch
to the GNU configure script for selecting the other sample format.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.3.0: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed tempo routine output duration inaccuracy due to rounding
error </li>
  <li> Implemented separate processing routines for integer and
floating arithmetic to allow improvements to floating point routines
(earlier used algorithms mostly optimized for integer arithmetic also
for floating point samples) </li>
  <li> Fixed a bug that distorts sound if sample rate changes during
the sound stream </li>
  <li> Fixed a memory leak that appeared in MMX/SSE/3DNow! optimized
routines </li>
  <li> Reduced redundant code pieces in MMX/SSE/3DNow! optimized
routines vs. the standard C routines. </li>
  <li> MMX routine incompatibility with new gcc compiler versions </li>
  <li> Other miscellaneous bug fixes </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2.1: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Added automake/autoconf scripts for GNU platforms (in courtesy
of David Durham) </li>
  <li> Fixed SCALE overflow bug in rate transposer routine. </li>
  <li> Fixed 64bit address space bugs. </li>
  <li> Created a 'soundtouch' namespace for SAMPLETYPE definitions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2.0: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Added support for 32bit floating point sample data type with
SSE/3DNow! optimizations for Win32 platform (SSE/3DNow! optimizations
currently not supported in GCC environment) </li>
  <li> Replaced 'make-gcc' script for GNU environment by master
Makefile </li>
  <li> Added time-stretch routine configurability to SoundTouch main
class </li>
  <li> Bugfixes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.1.1: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Moved SoundTouch under lesser GPL license (LGPL). This allows
using SoundTouch library in programs that aren't released under GPL
license. </li>
  <li> Changed MMX routine organiation so that MMX optimized routines
are now implemented in classes that are derived from the basic classes
having the standard non-mmx routines. </li>
  <li> MMX routines to support gcc version 3. </li>
  <li> Replaced windows makefiles by script using the .dsw files </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.0.1: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> "mmx_gcc.cpp": Added "using namespace std" and removed "return
0" from a function with void return value to fix compiler errors when
compiling the library in Solaris environment. </li>
  <li> Moved file "FIFOSampleBuffer.h" to "include" directory to allow
accessing the FIFOSampleBuffer class from external files. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.0: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Initial release </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>5.2. SoundStretch application Change History </h3>
<p><b>1.7.0:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Bugfixes in Wavfile: exception string formatting, avoid getLengthMs() integer 
        precision overflow</li>
</ul>
    <p><b>1.5.0:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li> Added "-speech" switch to activate algorithm parameters more
suitable for speech processing than the default parameters tuned for
music processing.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.4.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Moved BPM detection routines from SoundStretch application into
SoundTouch library </li>
  <li> Allow using standard input/output pipes as audio processing
input/output streams</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.3.0:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Simplified accessing WAV files with floating point sample
format. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2.1: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed 64bit address space bugs.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.2.0: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Added support for 32bit floating point sample data type </li>
  <li> Restructured the BPM routines into separate library </li>
  <li> Fixed big-endian conversion bugs in WAV file routines (hopefully
:)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.1.1: </strong> </p>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed bugs in WAV file reading &amp; added byte-order conversion
for big-endian processors. </li>
  <li> Moved SoundStretch source code under 'example' directory to
highlight difference from SoundTouch stuff. </li>
  <li> Replaced windows makefiles by script using the .dsw files </li>
  <li> Output file name isn't required if output isn't desired (e.g. if
using the switch '-bpm' in plain format only) </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>1.1:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed "Release" settings in Microsoft Visual C++ project file
(.dsp) </li>
  <li> Added beats-per-minute (BPM) detection routine and command-line
switch "-bpm" </li>
