/** A Fourier Transform is an algorithm that transforms a signal in the time domain, such as a sample buffer, into a signal in the
 * frequency domain, often called the spectrum. The spectrum does not represent individual frequencies, but actually represents
 * frequency bands centered on particular frequencies. The center frequency of each band is usually expressed as a fraction of the
 * sampling rate of the time domain signal and is equal to the index of the frequency band divided by the total number of bands.
 * The total number of frequency bands is usually equal to the length of the time domain signal, but access is only provided to
 * frequency bands with indices less than half the length, because they correspond to frequencies below the <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency">Nyquist frequency</a>. In other words, given a signal of length
 * <code>N</code>, there will be <code>N/2</code> frequency bands in the spectrum.
 * <p>
 * As an example, if you construct a FourierTransform with a <code>timeSize</code> of 1024 and and a <code>sampleRate</code> of
 * 44100 Hz, then the spectrum will contain values for frequencies below 22010 Hz, which is the Nyquist frequency (half the sample
 * rate). If you ask for the value of band number 5, this will correspond to a frequency band centered on
 * <code>5/1024 * 44100 = 0.0048828125 * 44100 = 215 Hz</code>. The width of that frequency band is equal to <code>2/1024</code>,
 * expressed as a fraction of the total bandwidth of the spectrum. The total bandwith of the spectrum is equal to the Nyquist
 * frequency, which in this case is 22100, so the bandwidth is equal to about 50 Hz. It is not necessary for you to remember all
 * of these relationships, though it is good to be aware of them. The function <code>getFreq()</code> allows you to query the
 * spectrum with a frequency in Hz and the function <code>getBandWidth()</code> will return the bandwidth in Hz of each frequency
 * band in the spectrum.
 * <p>
 * <b>Usage</b>
 * <p>
 * A typical usage of a FourierTransform is to analyze a signal so that the frequency spectrum may be represented in some way,
 * typically with vertical lines. You could do this in Processing with the following code, where <code>audio</code> is an
 * AudioSource and <code>fft</code> is an FFT (one of the derived classes of FourierTransform).
 * 
 * <pre>
 * fft.forward(audio.left);
 * for (int i = 0; i &lt; fft.specSize(); i++) {
 * 	// draw the line for frequency band i, scaling it by 4 so we can see it a bit better
 * 	line(i, height, i, height - fft.getBand(i) * 4);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <b>Windowing</b>
 * <p>
 * Windowing is the process of shaping the audio samples before transforming them to the frequency domain. If you call the
 * <code>window()</code> function with an appropriate constant, such as FourierTransform.HAMMING, the sample buffers passed to the
 * object for analysis will be shaped by the current window before being transformed. The result of using a window is to reduce
 * the noise in the spectrum somewhat.
 * <p>
 * <b>Averages</b>
 * <p>
 * FourierTransform also has functions that allow you to request the creation of an average spectrum. An average spectrum is
 * simply a spectrum with fewer bands than the full spectrum where each average band is the average of the amplitudes of some
 * number of contiguous frequency bands in the full spectrum.
 * <p>
 * <code>linAverages()</code> allows you to specify the number of averages that you want and will group frequency bands into
 * groups of equal number. So if you have a spectrum with 512 frequency bands and you ask for 64 averages, each average will span
 * 8 bands of the full spectrum.
 * <p>
 * <code>logAverages()</code> will group frequency bands by octave and allows you to specify the size of the smallest octave to
 * use (in Hz) and also how many bands to split each octave into. So you might ask for the smallest octave to be 60 Hz and to
 * split each octave into two bands. The result is that the bandwidth of each average is different. One frequency is an octave
 * above another when it's frequency is twice that of the lower frequency. So, 120 Hz is an octave above 60 Hz, 240 Hz is an
 * octave above 120 Hz, and so on. When octaves are split, they are split based on Hz, so if you split the octave 60-120 Hz in
 * half, you will get 60-90Hz and 90-120Hz. You can see how these bandwidths increase as your octave sizes grow. For instance, the
 * last octave will always span <code>sampleRate/4 - sampleRate/2</code>, which in the case of audio sampled at 44100 Hz is
 * 11025-22010 Hz. These logarithmically spaced averages are usually much more useful than the full spectrum or the linearly
 * spaced averages because they map more directly to how humans perceive sound.
 * <p>
 * <code>calcAvg()</code> allows you to specify the frequency band you want an average calculated for. You might ask for 60-500Hz
 * and this function will group together the bands from the full spectrum that fall into that range and average their amplitudes
 * for you.
 * <p>
 * If you don't want any averages calculated, then you can call <code>noAverages()</code>. This will not impact your ability to
 * use <code>calcAvg()</code>, it will merely prevent the object from calculating an average array every time you use
 * <code>forward()</code>.
 * <p>
 * <b>Inverse Transform</b>
 * <p>
 * FourierTransform also supports taking the inverse transform of a spectrum. This means that a frequency spectrum will be
 * transformed into a time domain signal and placed in a provided sample buffer. The length of the time domain signal will be
 * <code>timeSize()</code> long. The <code>set</code> and <code>scale</code> functions allow you the ability to shape the spectrum
 * already stored in the object before taking the inverse transform. You might use these to filter frequencies in a spectrum or
 * modify it in some other way.
