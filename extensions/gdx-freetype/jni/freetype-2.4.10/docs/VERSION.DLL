Due  to our  use of  `libtool' to  generate and  install the  FreeType 2
libraries on  Unix systems,  as well as  other historical events,  it is
generally very  difficult to  know precisely which  release of  the font
engine is installed on a given system.

This file tries  to explain why and to document  ways to properly detect
FreeType on Unix.


1. Version and Release numbers
------------------------------

For each new  public release of FreeType 2,  there are generally *three*
distinct `version' numbers to consider:

  * The official FreeType 2 release number, like 2.0.9 or 2.1.3.

  * The libtool (and Unix) specific version number, like 9.2.3.  This is
    what `freetype-config --version' returns.

  * The platform-specific  shared object  number, used for  example when
    the library is installed as `/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6.3.2'.

The platform-specific  number is, unsurprisingly,  platform-specific and
varies  with the  operating system  you are  using (several  variants of
Linux, FreeBSD,  Solaris, etc.).  You  should thus _never_ use  it, even
for simple tests.

The libtool-specific  number does  not equal the  release number  but is
tied to it.

The release number is available  at *compile* time through the following
macros defined in FT_FREETYPE_H:

  - FREETYPE_MAJOR: major release number
  - FREETYPE_MINOR: minor release number
  - FREETYPE_PATCH: patch release number

See below for a small autoconf fragment.

The  release   number  is  also  available  at   *runtime*  through  the
`FT_Library_Version' API.   Unfortunately, this one  wasn't available or
working correctly before the 2.1.3 official release.


2. History
----------

The following table gives,  for each official release, the corresponding
libtool  number, as well  as the  shared object  number found  on _most_
systems, but not all of them:


    release    libtool      so
  -------------------------------
     2.4.10     15.0.9    6.9.0

     2.3.10     9.21.3    6.3.21
     2.3.9      9.20.3    6.3.20
     2.3.8      9.19.3    6.3.19
     2.3.7      9.18.3    6.3.18
     2.3.6      9.17.3    6.3.17
     2.3.5      9.16.3    6.3.16
     2.3.4      9.15.3    6.3.15
     2.3.3      9.14.3    6.3.14
     2.3.2      9.13.3    6.3.13
     2.3.1      9.12.3    6.3.12
     2.3.0      9.11.3    6.3.11
     2.2.1      9.10.3    6.3.10
     2.2.0      9.9.3     6.3.9
     2.1.10     9.8.3     6.3.8
     2.1.9      9.7.3     6.3.7
     2.1.8      9.6.3     6.3.6
     2.1.7      9.5.3     6.3.5
     2.1.6      9.5.3     6.3.5
     2.1.5      9.4.3     6.3.4
     2.1.4      9.3.3     6.3.3
     2.1.3      9.2.3     6.3.2
     2.1.2      9.1.3     6.3.1
     2.1.1      9.0.3         ?
     2.1.0      8.0.2         ?
     2.0.9      9.0.3         ?
     2.0.8      8.0.2         ?
     2.0.4      7.0.1         ?
     2.0.1      6.1.0         ?

The libtool numbers are a bit inconsistent due to the library's history:

  - 2.1.0 was created as a development branch from 2.0.8 (hence the same
    libtool numbers).

  - 2.0.9  was  a  bug-fix  release  of  the  `stable'  branch,  and  we
    incorrectly increased its libtool number.

  - 2.1.4 was a development version, however it was stable  enough to be
    the basis of the 2.2.0 release.


3. Autoconf Code Fragment
-------------------------

Lars Clausen contributed the following autoconf fragment to detect which
version of  FreeType is  installed on  a system.  This  one tests  for a
version that  is at least 2.0.9;  you should change it  to check against
other release numbers.


  AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether FreeType version is 2.0.9 or higher])
  old_CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"
  CPPFLAGS=`freetype-config --cflags`
  AC_TRY_CPP([

#include <ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H
#if (FREETYPE_MAJOR*1000 + FREETYPE_MINOR)*1000 + FREETYPE_PATCH < 2000009
#error Freetype version too low.
#endif
  ],
  [AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
   FREETYPE_LIBS=`freetype-config --libs`
   AC_SUBST(FREETYPE_LIBS)
   AC_DEFINE(HAVE_FREETYPE,1,[Define if you have the FreeType2 library])
   CPPFLAGS="$old_CPPFLAGS"],
  [AC_MSG_ERROR([Need FreeType library version 2.0.9 or higher])])
