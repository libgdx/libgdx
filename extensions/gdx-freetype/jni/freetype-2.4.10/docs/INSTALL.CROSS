This document contains instructions on how to cross-build the FreeType
library on Unix systems, for example, building binaries for Linux/MIPS
on  FreeBSD/i386.   Before   reading  this  document,  please  consult
INSTALL.UNIX for required tools and the basic self-building procedure.


  1. Required Tools
  -----------------

    For self-building the FreeType library  on a Unix system, GNU Make
    3.80 or  newer is required.   INSTALL.UNIX  contains  hints how to
    check the installed `make'.

    The GNU C  compiler to cross-build the target  system is required.
    At present, using non-GNU cross compiler is not tested.  The cross
    compiler is  expected to be  installed with a system  prefix.  For
    example, if  your building system  is FreeBSD/i386 and  the target
    system is Linux/MIPS, the  cross compiler should be installed with
    the name `mips-ip22-linuxelf-gcc'.

    A C  compiler for a self-build  is required also, to  build a tool
    that  is executed  during  the building  procedure.  Non-GNU  self
    compilers are acceptable, but such a setup is not tested yet.


  2. Configuration
  ----------------

    2.1. Building and target system

      To configure for  cross-build, the options `--host=<system>' and
      `--build=<system>' must be passed to configure.  For example, if
      your building  system is FreeBSD/i386  and the target  system is
      Linux/MIPS, say

        ./configure \
          --build=i386-unknown-freebsd \
          --host=mips-ip22-linuxelf \
          [other options]

      It should  be noted that `--host=<system>'  specifies the system
      where the built binaries will  be executed, not the system where
      the build actually happens.   Older versions of GNU autoconf use
      the option  pair `--host=' and `--target='.  This  is broken and
      doesn't work.  Similarly, an explicit CC specification like

        env CC=mips-ip22-linux-gcc ./configure

      or

        env CC=/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/bin/gcc ./configure

      doesn't   work  either;  such   a  configuration   confuses  the
      `configure' script while  trying to find the cross  and native C
      compilers.


    2.2. The prefix to install FreeType2

      Setting `--prefix=<prefix>'  properly is important.   The prefix
      to install FreeType2 is  written into the freetype-config script
      and freetype2.pc configuration file.

      If  the built  FreeType  2 library  is  used as  a  part of  the
      cross-building system,  the prefix  is expected to  be different
      from the self-building  system.  For example, configuration with
      `--prefix=/usr/local'  installs binaries  into  the system  wide
      `/usr/local'  directory  which  then  can't be  executed.   This
      causes confusion in configuration  of all applications which use
      FreeType2.   Instead,  use a  prefix to install  the cross-build
      into     a     separate     system    tree,     for     example,
      `--prefix=/usr/local/mips-ip22-linux/'.

      On the other  hand, if the built FreeType2 is used  as a part of
      the target system, the prefix to install should reflect the file
      system structure of the target system.


  3. Building command
  -------------------

    If  the  configuration  finishes successfully,  invoking  GNU make
    builds FreeType2.  Just say

      make

    or

      gmake

    depending on the name the GNU make binary actually has.


  4. Installation
  ---------------

    Saying

      make install

    as usual to install FreeType2 into the directory tree specified by
    the argument of the `--prefix' option.

    As noted in section 2.2,  FreeType2  is sometimes configured to be
    installed  into the  system directory  of the  target  system, and
    should  not be installed  in the  cross-building system.   In such
    cases, the  make variable `DESTDIR'  is useful to change  the root
    directory in the installation.  For example, after

      make DESTDIR=/mnt/target_system_root/ install

    the built FreeType2 library files are installed into the directory
    `/mnt/target_system_root/<prefix_in_configure>/lib'.


  5. TODO
  -------

    Cross building between Cygwin (or MSys) and Unix must be tested.
