  # Detecting Windows NT is easy, as the OS variable must be defined and
  # contains `Windows_NT'.  This also works with Windows 2000 and XP.

    # Detecting Windows 9X

    # We used to run the `ver' command to see if its output contains the
    # word `Windows'.  If this is true, we are running Windows 95 or later:
    #
    #   ifdef COMSPEC
    #     # First, check if we have the COMSPEC environment variable, which
    #     # indicates we can use COMMAND.COM's internal commands
    #     is_windows := $(findstring Windows,$(strip $(shell ver)))
    #   endif
    #
    # Unfortunately, this also detects the case when one is running
    # DOS 7.x (the MS-DOS version that lies below Windows) without actually
    # launching the GUI.
    #
    # A better test is to check whether there are both the environment
    # variables `winbootdir' and `windir'.  The first indicates an
    # underlying DOS 7.x, while the second is set only if windows is
    # available.
    #
    # Note that on Windows NT, such an environment variable will not be seen
    # from DOS-based tools like DJGPP's make; this is not actually a problem
    # since NT is detected independently above.  But do not try to be clever!
    #

  # Setting COPY is a bit trickier.  Plain COPY on NT will not work
  # correctly, because it will uppercase 8.3 filenames, creating a

  # Since we do not want that, we need to force execution of CMD.EXE.
  # Unfortunately, CMD.EXE is not available on Windows 9X.
  # So we need to hack.
  #
  # Kudos to Eli Zaretskii (DJGPP guru) that helped debug it.
  # Details are available in threads of the freetype mailing list
