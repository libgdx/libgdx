  *  This is a development version of <ft2build.h> to build the library in
  *  debug mode.  Its only difference to the default version is that it
  *  includes a local `ftoption.h' header file with different settings for
  *  many configuration macros.
  *
  *  To use it, simply ensure that the directory containing this file is
  *  scanned by the compiler before the default FreeType header directory.
