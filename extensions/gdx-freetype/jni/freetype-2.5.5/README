  FreeType 2.5.5
  ==============

  Homepage: http://www.freetype.org

  FreeType is a freely available software library to render fonts.

  It  is  written  in  C,  designed to  be  small,  efficient,  highly
  customizable, and  portable while capable of  producing high-quality
  output  (glyph  images) of  most  vector  and bitmap  font  formats.

  Please   read   the  docs/CHANGES   file,   it  contains   IMPORTANT
  INFORMATION.

  Read the  files `docs/INSTALL*'  for installation  instructions; see
  the file `docs/LICENSE.TXT' for the available licenses.

  The FreeType 2 API reference is located in `docs/reference'; use the

  Mailing Lists

  e-mail lists.

    general use and discussion:      freetype@nongnu.org
    engine internals, porting, etc.: freetype-devel@nongnu.org
    announcements:                   freetype-announce@nongnu.org

  Bugs
  ====

  Please submit bug reports at

    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?group=freetype

  Alternatively,    you   might    report    bugs    by   e-mail    to
  `freetype-devel@nongnu.org'.   Don't  forget   to  send  a  detailed
  explanation of the problem --  there is nothing worse than receiving
  a terse message that only says `it doesn't work'.


  Enjoy!
