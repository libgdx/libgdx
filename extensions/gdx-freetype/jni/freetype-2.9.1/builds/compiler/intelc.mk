#   These should concern: debug output, optimization & warnings.

#   Use the ANSIFLAGS variable to define the compiler flags used to enfore
#   ANSI compliance.
#
#   Note that the Intel C/C++ compiler version 4.5 complains about
#   the use of FT_FIELD_OFFSET with "value must be arithmetic type"!
#   This really looks like a bug in the compiler because the macro
#   _does_ compute an arithmetic value, so we disable this warning
#   with "/Qwd32".
