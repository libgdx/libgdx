# This library file contains definitions of classes needed to decompose C
# source code files into a series of multi-line `blocks'.  There are two
# kinds of blocks.
#
#   - Normal blocks, which contain source code or ordinary comments.
#
#   - Documentation blocks, which have restricted formatting, and whose text
#     always start with a documentation markup tag like `<Function>',
#     `<Type>', etc.
#
# The routines to process the content of documentation blocks are contained
# in file `content.py'; the classes and methods found here only deal with
# text parsing and basic documentation block extraction.

##  SOURCE BLOCK FORMAT CLASS
##
##  A simple class containing compiled regular expressions to detect
##  potential documentation format block comments within C source code.
##
##  The `column' pattern must contain a group to `unbox' the content of
##  documentation comment blocks.
##
##  Later on, paragraphs are converted to long lines, which simplifies the
##  regular expressions that act upon the text.
