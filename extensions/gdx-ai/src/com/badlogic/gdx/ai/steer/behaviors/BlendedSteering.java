/** This combination behavior simply sums up all the behaviors, applies their weights, and truncates the result before returning.
 * There are no constraints on the blending weights; they don't have to sum to one, for example, and rarely do. Don't think of
 * {@code BlendedSteering} as a weighted mean, because it's not.
 * <p>
 * With {@code BlendedSteering} you can combine multiple behaviors to get a more complex behavior. It can work fine, but the
 * trade-off is that it comes with a few problems:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Since every active behavior is calculated every time step, it can be a costly method to process.</li>
 * <li>Behavior weights can be difficult to tweak. There have been research projects that have tried to evolve the steering
 * weights using genetic algorithms or neural networks. Results have not been encouraging, however, and manual experimentation
 * still seems to be the most sensible approach.</li>
 * <li>It's problematic with conflicting forces. For instance, a common scenario is where an agent is backed up against a wall by
 * several other agents. In this example, the separating forces from the neighboring agents can be greater than the repulsive
 * force from the wall and the agent can end up being pushed through the wall boundary. This is almost certainly not going to be
 * favorable. Sure you can make the weights for the wall avoidance huge, but then your agent may behave strangely next time it
 * finds itself alone and next to a wall.</li>
 * </ul>
