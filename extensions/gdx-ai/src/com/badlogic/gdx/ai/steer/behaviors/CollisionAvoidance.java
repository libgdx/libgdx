/** {@code CollisionAvoidance} behavior steers the owner to avoid obstacles lying in its path. An obstacle is any object that can be
 * approximated by a circle (or sphere, if you are working in 3D).
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses collision prediction working out the closest approach of two agents and determining if their distance
 * at this point is less than the sum of their bounding radius. For avoiding groups of characters, averaging positions and
 * velocities do not work well with this approach. Instead, the algorithm needs to search for the character whose closest approach
 * will occur first and to react to this character only. Once this imminent collision is avoided, the steering behavior can then
 * react to more distant characters.
 * <p>
 * This algorithm works well with small and/or moving obstacles whose shape can be approximately represented by a center and a
 * radius.
 * 
 * @param <T> Type of vector, either 2D or 3D, implementing the {@link Vector} interface
