/** {@code FollowPath} behavior produces a linear acceleration that moves the agent along the given path. First it calculates the
 * agent location based on the specified prediction time. Then it works out the position of the internal target based on the
 * location just calculated and the shape of the path. It finally uses {@link Seek seek} behavior to move the owner towards the
 * internal target position. However, if the path is open {@link Arrive arrive} behavior is used to approach path's extremities
 * when they are far less than the {@link FollowPath#decelerationRadius deceleration radius} from the internal target position.
 * <p>
 * For complex paths with sudden changes of direction the predictive behavior (i.e., with prediction time greater than 0) can
 * appear smoother than the non-predictive one (i.e., with no prediction time). However, predictive path following has the
 * downside of cutting corners when some sections of the path come close together. This cutting-corner attitude can make the
 * character miss a whole section of the path. This might not be what you want if, for example, the path represents a patrol
 * route.
