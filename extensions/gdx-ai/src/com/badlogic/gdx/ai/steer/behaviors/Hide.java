/** This behavior attempts to position a owner so that an obstacle is always between itself and the agent (the hunter) it's trying
 * to hide from. First the distance to each of these obstacles is determined. Then the owner uses the arrive behavior to steer
 * toward the closest one. If no appropriate obstacles can be found, no steering is returned.
 * <p>
 * You can use this behavior not only for situations where you require a non-player character (NPC) to hide from the player, like
 * find cover when fired at, but also in situations where you would like an NPC to sneak up on a player. For example, you can
 * create an NPC capable of stalking a player through a gloomy forest, darting from tree to tree.
 * <p>
 * It's worth mentioning that since this behavior can produce no steering acceleration it is commonly used with
 * {@link PrioritySteering}. For instance, to make the owner go away from the target if there are no obstacles nearby to hide
 * behind, just use {@link Hide} and {@link Evade} behaviors with this priority order.
 * <p>
 * There are a few interesting modifications you might want to make to this behavior:
 * <ul>
 * <li>With {@link FieldOfViewProximity} you can allow the owner to hide only if the target is within its field of view. This
 * tends to produce unsatisfactory performance though, because the owner starts to act like a child hiding from monsters beneath
 * the bed sheets, something like "if you can't see it, then it can't see you" effect making the owner look dumb. This can be
 * countered slightly though by adding in a time effect so that the owner will hide if the target is visible or if it has seen the
 * target within the last {@code N} seconds. This gives it a sort of memory and produces reasonable-looking behavior.</li>
 * <li>The same as above, but this time the owner only tries to hide if the owner can see the target and the target can see the
 * owner.
 * <li>It might be desirable to produce a force that steers the owner so that it always favors hiding positions that are to the
 * side or rear of the pursuer. This can be achieved easily using the dot product to bias the distances returned from the method
 * {@link #getHidingPosition}.</li>
 * <li>At the beginning of any of the methods a check can be made to test if the target is within a "threat distance" before
 * proceeding with any further calculations. If the target is not a threat, then the method can return immediately with zero
 * steering.</li>
 * </ul>
