/** {@code Pursue} behavior produces a force that steers the agent towards the evader (the target). Actually it predicts where an
 * agent will be in time @{code t} and seeks towards that point to intercept it. We did this naturally playing tag as children,
 * which is why the most difficult tag players to catch were those who kept switching direction, foiling our predictions.
 * <p>
 * This implementation performs the prediction by assuming the target will continue moving with the same velocity it currently
 * has. This is a reasonable assumption over short distances, and even over longer distances it doesn't appear too stupid. The
 * algorithm works out the distance between character and target and works out how long it would take to get there, at maximum
 * speed. It uses this time interval as its prediction lookahead. It calculates the position of the target if it continues to move
 * with its current velocity. This new position is then used as the target of a standard seek behavior.
 * <p>
 * If the character is moving slowly, or the target is a long way away, the prediction time could be very large. The target is
 * less likely to follow the same path forever, so we'd like to set a limit on how far ahead we aim. The algorithm has a
 * {@code maxPredictionTime} for this reason. If the prediction time is beyond this, then the maximum time is used.
