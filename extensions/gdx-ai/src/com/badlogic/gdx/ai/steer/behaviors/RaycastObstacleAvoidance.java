/** With the {@code RaycastObstacleAvoidance} the moving agent (the owner) casts one or more rays out in the direction of its
 * motion. If these rays collide with an obstacle, then a target is created that will avoid the collision, and the owner does a
 * basic seek on this target. Typically, the rays extend a short distance ahead of the character (usually a distance corresponding
 * to a few seconds of movement).
 * <p>
 * This behavior is especially suitable for large-scale obstacles like walls.
 * <p>
 * You should use the {@link RayConfiguration} more suitable for your game environment. Some basic ray configurations are provided
 * by the framework: {@link SingleRayConfiguration}, {@link ParallelSideRayConfiguration} and
 * {@link CentralRayWithWhiskersConfiguration}. There are no hard and fast rules as to which configuration is better. Each has its
 * own particular idiosyncrasies. A single ray with short whiskers is often the best initial configuration to try but can make it
 * impossible for the character to move down tight passages. The single ray configuration is useful in concave environments but
 * grazes convex obstacles. The parallel configuration works well in areas where corners are highly obtuse but is very susceptible
 * to the corner trap.
 * <p>
 * <a name="cornerTrap">
 * <h2>The corner trap</h2></a> All the basic configurations for multi-ray obstacle avoidance can suffer from a crippling problem
 * with acute angled corners (any convex corner, in fact, but it is more prevalent with acute angles). Consider a character with
 * two parallel rays that is going towards a corner. As soon as its left ray is colliding with the wall near the corner, the
 * steering behavior will turn it to the left to avoid the collision. Immediately, the right ray will then be colliding the other
 * side of the corner, and the steering behavior will turn the character to the right. The character will repeatedly collide both
 * sides of the corner in rapid succession. It will appear to home into the corner directly, until it slams into the wall. It will
 * be unable to free itself from the trap.
 * <p>
 * The fan structure, with a wide enough fan angle, alleviates this problem. Often, there is a trade-off, however, between
 * avoiding the corner trap with a large fan angle and keeping the angle small to allow the character to access small passages. At
 * worst, with a fan angle near PI radians, the character will not be able to respond quickly enough to collisions detected on its
 * side rays and will still graze against walls. There are two approaches that work well and represent the most practical
 * solutions to the problem:
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>Adaptive fan angles:</b> If the character is moving successfully without a collision, then the fan angle is narrowed. If
 * a collision is detected, then the fan angle is widened. If the character detects many collisions on successive frames, then the
 * fan angle will continue to widen, reducing the chance that the character is trapped in a corner.</li>
 * <li><b>Winner ray:</b> If a corner trap is detected, then one of the rays is considered to have won, and the collisions
 * detected by other rays are ignored for a while.</li>
 * </ul>
 * It seems that the most practical solution is to use adaptive fan angles, with one long ray cast and two shorter whiskers.
